An extremely young girl who seemed to be 13 at most was simultaneously watching the store while watching this tiny little boy. While she was getting ice cream the little boy was entirely unattended and most definitely not safe. Not a single eye on him all alone at the front of the store. Older woman who probably should have been running the store was in back playing computer games with a gaming headset on. Super uncomfortable. Had to leave without buying anything because the poor little girl running the store could not handle the customers and i felt terrible adding to her workload.

They have a large range of Bubble Tea, I tried the Green Tea with Honeydew which was very good, not too much/overly sweet. It is the real deal, you can have a choice of the boba or bubble flavors, today I chose between Mango, Peach and the Honeydew. If the boba or tea is not your thing, they have a range of ice cream by local favorite Richardson's and a couple of slush flavors by another local company Richie's.  Also coolers of bottled juice drinks, some Asian some not, as well as energy bars and other snacks.  The have window seating, a large center table--that will work for a large group or a local meeting, and some comfy arm chairs. I'm sure they are trying to settle into this new location, and their signs haven't even arrived yet.  Service was friendly and this is authentic blending of the tea drink -- it was a large portion that was sealed over the cover and I was given one of those extra wide straws/also sealed.\n",

      "The froyo craze continues with this new self-serve frozen yogurt cafe in Downtown Melrose. Having been a loyal Zinga customer for the past year, I thought I'd give Pink Melon a try since it's closer to my house. First of all though, Pink Melon? Who decided that all frozen yogurt restaurants had to be named \"color fruit\"? Red Mango, Pink Berry, etc... This isn't even a chain, it's family owned...\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, Pink Melon is very similar to all of the other froyo places popping up everywhere. It has the wall of froyo machines with 10-12 flavors, the fruit and candy toppings bar, bright colored walls, and funky chairs. The selection of flavors was very basic, though numerous; I wonder if they rotate them on a daily basis? I found it odd that the machines seemed to be the same ones you get icees from, not the typical soft serve machines I've seen elsewhere. I don't know if it was because of these machines, but the vanilla was coming out watery and it seemed like my froyo melted pretty quickly once I sat down to eat it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fruit at the toppings bar didn't seem fresh: the blueberries and cherries were mushy and smashed together in the container. I did appreciate the selection though and loved that cheesecake was one of the options. The candy and chocolate pieces were smaller than they are at Zinga. For example, they had Reese's mini cups instead of crushed full sized Reese's and smaller chocolate covered pretzels. It made mixing my froyo much easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't accept cards when I was there, but I think they might not have set the card reader up yet? Pricing was typical at 49 cents an ounce. I wish they had some sort of rewards program though.\n",

      "Bottom line, Pink Melon isn't amazing, but I don't see why you wouldn't go here over any of the other froyo places.\n",

      "I would have given more stars if it wasn't for an uncomfortable experience today. We literally went the first day they opened and I was pleasantly surprised. Delicious frozen yoghurt flavors and all is help yourself. You can take as much or as little as you want because the price is based on the weight of your container. Plus they offer a free sample if you're not sure of the flavor. Anyhow, the place was cute. However, my husband and I had a sudden frozen yoghurt craving, so we stopped by, just to be horrified at how rude the manager was to his employees. The man was literally screaming at a young girl and taunting her asking if \"she's tired and would like to go home\". I'm not sure what was happening but it was super uncomfortable. The manager appeared  crazed. For what its worth, the employees seemed like they were doing their jobs???I felt bad and really just wanted to drop my yoghurt and leave, but I didn't. Hopefully this is an isolated incident. I'm not sure if I will go back anytime soon.\n",

The selection of toppings is about double what Orange Leaf offers, and the price seems to be much less (didn't check the cost per pound, just seems at Orange Leaf it's always $7 while at Pink Melon it was $4)\n",
      "\n",
      "It's an unusually hot day today and there were lots of kids in the shop enjoying their FroYo.    However the owners or employees were dour, the TV was a tele-preacher going on about Jesus, the place echoed like fresh drywall, and the overall impression I had was that this place is not as inviting as an Orange Leaf.        They may have opened too soon as a worker was putting up decorative wall cover (which might help diffuse the echoey sound), and I did like the decor overall.      \n",

Zinga is the closest thing I've found, but thankfully Yogurtland is opening franchises in Massachusetts FINALLY.\n",
      "Anyways, went to Pink Melon about a month after it had opened with my boyfriend and was not pleased at all. Seemed like the place was still being put together with tacky decor, TV was not on a good channel, and I am assuming the owner was having a business meeting right in the corner with two other guys... not welcoming. The flavor I get at every place was not working here and so opted for the Vanilla, where it came out watery and tasted DISGUSTING. Topping selection seemed on par with others. Pricing seemed fine from what I can remember. \n",
      "I sat down with my boyfriend and chatted for a while. No one else was in the place except for the owner w/ his meeting. A high school-aged girl came in to begin her shift while we were eating and apparently forgot her uniform hat. The owner was basically outraged and gave the girl a ridiculously hard time about the hat. He made her go in the back and get a replacement one. The other girl working the register had it on and let me tell you, the hats just looked stupid. The owner seemed like a total a--hole and to be honest, made my experience even worse. He's part of the reason I won't be returning, because he made a spectacle in front of customers (my boyfriend and I). \n",

      "Hmmm..I don't really know, the atmosphere seemed inviting and I liked the back wall with the green sparkling lights but the layout seemed strange and there was little seating.  I struggled between giving it 2 or 3 stars, so I figured I would give them the 2 :) because they can always improve. First, the most disappointing was that of all the flavors available, they did not offer one sugar-free flavor; just one sugar-free flavor would have been great as I cut sugar out of my diet last year. I still have a sweet tooth so when that day comes I enjoy running to Zenga (on route 1) and having myself a small cup of the sugar-free fro-yo. So for me personally, this was a big drawback; and is the reason I will most likely not return. Second, the flavors are listed above the machines, but they do not provide any information about them, i.e. low-fat, fat free, ingredients, etc. At Zenga each flavor tag provides all of this. The yogurt machines are also weird and yogurt came out slow, watery and 2 of the machines that were supposedly working had nothing come out. And third, well the girl working there, although she seemed nice, did not seem to know what she was doing and she had friends hanging out there which she spent a great deal of time talking to and seemed to be bothered by customers. A customer asked what bubble tea was and she was not able to answer them, she stood there and said \"umm bubble tea, umm what is it, hmmm.\" Lastly, the yogurt flavors were very basic and just okay--not worth the price.  For me though, even though this yogurt shop is within walking distance to my house, Zenga is my first choice.\n",
