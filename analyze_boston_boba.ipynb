      "They have a tiny sauce area with sriracha, soy sauce, vinegar, and ginger sauce (soy sauce with ginger). I was expecting match sticks of ginger in the ginger sauce, but no luck! I also wished they had like chopped scallions here so that you can \"make your own sauce\". \n",

      "When we got to the car, my daughters noticed that they'd forgotten the two bubble teas we ordered.  Instead of just going to make the drinks, they spent a long time going back over the receipts first.  The worker was having trouble making the drinks and the owner walked over looking as if she were going to help, but instead mostly berated the worker in front of the restaurant; instead, she should have made the drinks and trained him later.  This made us very uncomfortable.\n",

A smile, a thank you, and a sorry for the wait can go a long way.  Hostility out of frustration is not a great plan for customer service.\n",

      "Got milk foam oolong with white boba and it was really good! Not too sweet or salty and just enough ice. The second time I had gotten pudding and regular boba with my oolong milk tea, however the pudding looked curdled. I asked someone and they had said that it was good to drink so it may just be the appearance (or a type I'm unaware of). The texture was grainy and not smooth like other puddings I have had, but the taste was sweet. Milk foam was my favorite drink, so I will stick to that! Good overall :)\n",
      "Finally. Real bubble tea in the area.  It's really nice to have quality bubble tea without having to go into town.\n",
      "Gong cha is easily the second best boba place I've been to here in Massachusetts. Their Earl gray with boba is my go to. Some times I would go for their caramel milk tea with boba as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like this location since it's right inside the mall and you can pretty much make a stop for boba before your meal at the food court or right after your meal for dessert. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a big wall with all their drinks that is eye level for customers to see which is super helpful. I hate the menus above the cashiers because most people get to the cashier just to look at the menu while holding up the line. Instead you can just walk up to the wall and pick out what you want, once you know what you want you can get in line and order. Their step by step on the wall is great for boba noobs haha.\n",
      "Came in on a Saturday around 4 PM. There was a line of about 10 people ahead of me, but it moved quickly. I got the large QQ passionfruit green tea with less ice and 70% sugar for $6. The drink was very sweet, but still enjoyable. It came with a generous amount boba and lychee jelly, and the boba was soft and chewy.\n",
      "Really really good bubble tea with a lot of options. They deliver through door-dash, and the cups are sealed which we like - if you have seen the video of the Uber eats driver taking a sip of a milkshake before he delivers it you'll know what I mean - thanks to their sealed cups you can rest assured nobody has sampled your drink!!!\n",
      "Mango soy milk slush with boba and reduced sugar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Staff moves through line very quickly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Great milk foam tea! Their boba is also pretty decently made! Satisfied. Way better than the one in Chinatown.\n",
      "无法想象，都9012年了还有用这种色素做出来的紫色香芋奶茶，也就罢了，还打着连锁店贡茶的名号，连菜单也和别的连锁店截然不同，实在无法忍受，只能差评。香芋奶茶很差，喝过奥利奥还行\n",
      "I always get the original milk tea and it's amazing.  I love the mango slush too,  all the flavors are very good .  I would definitely recommend this place to boba tea lovers.\n",
      "Really good bubble tea here. The first time I came to Gong Cha I got an Earl Grey Milk Tea, regular sugar and ice. It was very tasty, but I think next time I would get it with 70% sugar as it was quite sweet. The second time I tried to be a little more adventurous and ordered the Brown Sugar Milk Tea with less sugar and ice, which really hit the spot! It was nice and sweet with just a touch of deep brown sugar caramel-like flavor to give it an extra pop. Overall really enjoyed the boba here!\n",
      "This place is awesome.  They have varieties of drinks and you can customize how you want it and sugar level choice by percentage is pretty good idea.  It was my first visit and I took sometime to figure out the ordering system.  The cashier was very friendly and patient to walk me through the ordering system.  I had a large passion fruit green tea with pearl and regular sugar (70%) and it was very good.  I will go back and start exploring other flavors and I definitely recommend this place.\n",
      "Milk foam is the best! I like Gongcha better than Kung Fu Tea in general because the tea has more flavor.\n",
      "I didn't even know what Gong Cha was. My friend kindly corrected my ignorance and told me it was an awesome bubble tea (boba) chain that was FINALLY coming into the Boston market. I asked her if it was as good as Kung Fu Tea, which is a little too sweet for me sometimes, and she said it was even better! We stopped by right before closing and I ordered the Taro Milk Tea. It was great! Boba is hard to mess up, but when it's bad it's bad, and when it's good, it's great. Best part was, that even then I strolled in at 8:50, they were cheerful, and happy to get my order started, and as it was Grand Opening week, they gave my toddler a balloon, which made her happy, and made this mama happy!\n",
      "One of the best bubble tea places I've ever been to! I've gone to many other local bubble tea places and Gong Cha has the highest of quality. Also, it's very consistent each time I go.\n",
      "Carmel milk tea with boba very good! That's my new favorite place  the service lady is friendly\n",
      "I'd suggest the owner to update the prices on the menu, so the customers don't get surprised when the drinks cost higher than expected. It's digital and should be an easy fix. I don't care about the quarter at all but its all about the feeling. Otherwise the drink itself is usually gong cha quality.\n",
      "This place is the Starbucks for Bubble tea!\n",
      "Pretty upscale setting, tons of items ,lots of room for customizations and interesting toppings to choose from. \n",
      "I have always known Bubble tea to come with Tapioca pearls and so was lost looking at 10 the other toppings listed. I would definitely go back to try drinks with toppings like pudding, basil seeds. \n",
      "A huge thumbs up for letting the customers pick their sugar level and ice level for their drink, which got me saying \"yayyyy!!\"\n",
      "The available options for sugar are :100%,70%,50%,30% and 0.\n",
      "I ordered the classic- pearl milk tea (cold) with 30% Sugar. There medium one costed me $4.55 which I would say is not great with price, but not bad either. \n",
      "They do have an option to chose soy milk over regular milk. Why did I drop a star you may ask. The place is strictly a take out one in d mall .No seating area available within the store even if you do want to sit and sip. Probably made sense as it's in d mall,but again...\n",
      "Best bubble tea shop for me and my family. I always visited here in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. My favorite is Red Plum tea but not in Europe or America side. So good ...\n",
      "Bought two taro milk teas here and they forgot to put pearls in one of them. I drove all the way back to have them make a new one. But the lady at the cashier had the audacity to ask me for 50 cents to pay for the pearls when they were the ones that forgot to put the pearls in. Ridiculous. Will not be visiting this location again.\n",
      "Milkfoam and pudding were terrible compared to Allston store. Afternoon staffs were busy talking and not noticed me waiting. Also no seats. Will not come back.\n",
      "I got oolong milk tea hot, with 30% sugar. It was good. Sugar level was accurate, however the tea wasn't as strong. But overall, it was good. \n",
      "We also got milk tea with herbal jelly, which my friend thinks it's excellent. \n",
      "\n",
      "But we are sooooo GLAD that we have a proper milk tea option in burlington now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome Gong Cha!\n",
      "Their drinks are okay, nothing spectacular. I would prefer Kung Fu Tea any day. They are overpriced and seating isn't great. They have lots of different drinks but the menu seems too overwhelming. I wouldn't frequent, although the workers are nice!\n",
      "Visited again on a Saturday. This time there was only one person in line, so service was quick. I ordered from their new strawberry series and got a large matcha strawberry latte ($6) with strawberry boba ($0.75). I asked for 70% sweet, but they said the sweetness is fixed for the drink. The drink did not have a strong matcha or strawberry flavor. The strawberry boba was NOT strawberry flavored boba, instead it had a strange crunchy texture to it. Overall the drink was expensive and I would not recommend it. Would still visit gong cha for other drinks though!\n",
      "Great Gong Cha location!\n",
      "\n",
      "You never know what's up in the mall, I mean honestly, food courts can be hit or miss with the quality and value. So this Gong Cha is right adjacent to the food court, super clean location, not a very long line even on a busy weekend afternoon, friendly staff and quick service. The prices are standard for the Gong Cha chain of stores. High quality and tasty drinks. Gong Cha sets the standard for good bubble tea and this location is no exception.\n",
      "4.5 stars! This is the Gongcha that I go to the most frequently just because it is closeby. It's comparable in quality to the Chinatown location, but I believe it deserves a higher rating because it's rare to find such good boba outside of Boston or Lowell. This place beats both of the boba shops I've tried in Lowell, actually, now that I think of it...\n",
      "\n",
      "This location is inside of the Burlington Mall, near the food court. There isn't any seating inside of the shop (which I find quite odd) so I enjoy my drink at the food court instead. The service is pretty fast and the store only seems to grow in popularity the more I visit. \n",
      "\n",
      "My go-to order is the Brown Sugar Oolong Milk Foam, and I get it at the lowest possible sugar level--50%--and with no ice. The combination of the oolong tea, the sweetness of brown sugar from the drink and the tapioca pearls, and the creamy and slightly salty milk foam forms a perfectly balanced drink. I highly recommend it :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, I've tried Green Milk Tea with 50% sugar and white pearls, and it took a longer time to be prepared--I'm assuming because barely any people order white pearls--but I still enjoyed it.\n",
      "This is the best boba place nearby, and I was not disappointed. Although it could be considered slightly overpriced, I think it is reasonable and tastes extremely good. It has a pretty diverse menu for such a small place and the wait time is very short. I would recommend it to anyone who wants boba and doesn't want to commute to Boston or Allston \n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. they have gift cards, for those, like me, who love boba ;)\n",
      "Mediocre and a bit overpriced bubble tea.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Best pro is you can customize the amount of sugar, I always choose 0% sugar since the milk teas are already naturally sweet enough.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I've ordered the following drinks and the order is how I'd rank them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Early Gray Milk Tea with pearls: The earl gray flavor is pretty noticeable but not too strong.  I recommend with 0% Sugar.  I tried 30% sugar but that was way too sweet.  No idea how people drink this stuff with regular sugar.  \n",
      "2.  Mango Slush: Decent flavor but it was half liquid/melted as soon as I got it.  It's quite bad compared to other slushes I've had before.  Go to China Town in Boston to get the best slushes.  \n",
      "3.  Caramel Milk Tea with pearls:  Again go with 0% sugar, the caramel flavor is quite strong.  However my 2nd caramel milk tea was really gross--the caramel flavor tasted like some kind of coffee flavorer.  I can't recommend this drink again.\n",
      "Had brown sugar milk tea with pearls two days ago. The tea tasted rich but the \"pearl\" tasted bad like already stored in fridge overnight. A good \"pearl\" should be smooth and chewy which has to be freshly made the same day.\n",
      "Excited to hear that they opened a Gong Cha outside of  Boston. Easily accessible for those who are living in the 'burbs, bringing some high quality bubble tea our way. Went to visit this location when I was visiting  home for the holidays. Good stuff, everything you'd expect from the franchise, variety of different types of teas and customization. It's small location since it's located in the Burlington Mall by  the food  court. I definitely recommend this place, if you're looking for some authentic bubble tea!\n",
      "Consider this zero stars. 5 workers all standing around on their phones, place was empty and it took 10 full minutes for somebody to realize that after my order was taken, no one made the actual  drink. Then someone popped their head up from her phone and asked \"what are you waiting for?\"  I replied \" My large Milk tea\". Then they all looked at each other confused, and began to make it. Another 6 min ( no lie, I was counting at this point) and still nothing. A different girl looked up from her phone. \"What are you waiting for?\" Since I was the only person there, I began to look for the candid cameras. \"My milk tea\". She looked over down the counter, grabbed my tea and gave it to me. All the ice had melted by now and it a mess. This is basic level tasks here. If I owned this place I would be furious, but I'm lucky I can just not go back\n",
      "I love gong cha in Boston. So my expectations are high and this location wasn't great. I always order the same drink (earl grey milk tea with 3 js) and it tasted so bland. This drink has a lot of toppings Already and I even added milkfoam which usually adds more taste and even then it doesn't taste as good as the Boston location. Drinks needs to improve!!\n",
      "Its a Gongcha! Close to the mall food court so I can also get my sushi and Chick-fil-a on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality I expect from the franchise.\n",
      "Had the oolong milk tea with 50% sugar and less ice and it tasted on par with some good boba tea places I've had over the years. \n",
      "\n",
      "$4.55 for a medium with boba\n",
      "I was excited to find a Boba shop inside the mall. My daughter and I ordered the pearl milk tea and I have to say it was really good! The customer service was slightly lacking but I was happy to find that the tea and Boba was better than I expected. We will come back whenever shopping!\n",
      "My daughter and I spent some time at the Burlingron Mall and it has been our tradition to get a snack (mostly pretzels or bubble tea) on our way out. We were getting ready to leave and out of the corner of our eye, we saw a new spot, beautifully decorated, just before said food court. Being attracted to bright and shiny, we naturally had to check it out and I'm glad we did. Against the back wall was the menu and instructions on how to order. They have an extensive menu of traditional bubble teas and milk teas and you have lots of options to customize your beverage. You can order with various toppings, sweetness and ice levels. I have always been a fan of bubble teas and this place did not disappoint. It is like the Starbucks of Bubble Tea! Our order was awesome- thai tea latte with boba and oreo milk with oreo milk foam. Yum. We will definately be back...often!!!\n",
      "Excellent drinks and friendly staff. I ordered Pearl Milk Tea with Boba, very good. This restaurant has to be new because I didn't see it there before. It's awesome that there is one now in the mall as milk tea is very poplar nowadays.\n",
      "Strawberry green tea is da best (tastes like real fruit) and the boba was chewy. I ordered takeout via yelp and they were speedy and prompt\n",
      "So happy to have a Gong Cha walking distance from me. My boyfriend and I were definitely bummed when the soft opening and the grand opening got pushed back, but it was definitely worth the wait!! We stopped by on a Thursday night a little after 8:30pm during their grand opening (b1g1 from top 10) and the line was out the door and wrapped around the exit. Really spacious and modern for a bubble tea spot- I love it! More than enough space to social distance! \n",
      "\n",
      "Only one party inside to order at a time during COVID. A ton of menus all over the windows and inside as well. This was really helpful so people know what they want when they get to the cashier while keeping the line moving quickly. The cashier was super friendly-- overall great energy! There are tables and high chairs inside while you wait for your orders. I love the big Gong Cha sign to take photos at with your drinks ;) \n",
      "\n",
      "The flow of this bubble spot is great! One way in to order and walk out on the opposite side. This makes it so easy for customers so we are not running into each other. Also, some patio table and chairs at the exit door as well! \n",
      "\n",
      "Employees were awesome!! Even at 8:30pm they were super busy and the staff were just flying through all the drink orders with no complaints. They were all super nice and really efficient, great job!! \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the earl gray with 3 j's and my boyfriend got the pearl milk tea with caramel. One word, perfection! Our drinks tastes sooo much better than any other location, Chinatown, Burlington, Cambridge. Malden is definitely our go to! \n",
      "\n",
      "Love the fact that they open late! 11am to 11pm, who can beat that? There is also a little parking area right outside. Perfect location-- I'll be back soon :)\n",
      "Saw this place was new and open as I drove by, so I swung in to check it out. I am SO happy I did. First, they have wintermelon milk tea, which is not available everywhere. Second, the quality is great. I didn't feel like there was a chemical aftertaste (like some other places nearby), and the tea was fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "They give you multiple customization options like ice and sugar percentage, which is great too, although I usually stick to the status quo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be back!\n",
      "I WISH THEY HAD A LOYALTY PROGRAM ALREADY!\n",
      "Only went there twice and already spent $100.  Both times I ordered ahead through Grubhub and was told by one of the employee that prices are the same ordering in store and on Grubhub Pickup Option. Turns out, not all prices are the same through Grubhub. Just found out it's cheaper through ChowBus.  My first order were 12 drinks. They only made mistake on 1. They forgot the red beans in the matcha latte. I called them and the girl was really nice and she said she'll take down my name and the next time that I order they'll remember to give me a free topping. My second order, I put in the note about my free topping and one of the girl called me right away and gave me a free topping in one of the drinks. I usually go to KFT but so far, drinks that I like, Gong Cha's tastes better. Gong Cha makes really good winter melon drinks and their herbal jelly has better texture than KFT. But I think KFT has chewier texture boba. Overall, I wish I've gotten points/rewards so far.\n",
      "This is the nicest Gong Cha I've ever seen! Everything is sparkling, new, and clean. There is plenty of seating both inside and outside. And the layout of the store is well-thought-out for COVID-19 distancing. The drinks are also consistently excellent. My go-to is the milk foam dirty brown sugar milk tea. It's cold, creamy, sweet, salty, and just perfect. I also really enjoyed the Earl Grey Milk Tea with 3Js, which was unique and a textural delight. The boba are always cooked just right. At $5-6 for the medium size of the drinks I just mentioned, it's pricey for a drink, but consistent with what I would pay in Chinatown, and I don't even have to go downtown! The staff are also excellent. They're helpful at the register and get the drinks out quickly. I've never had a drink order come out wrong here. This will be my new go-to bubble tea place in Malden.\n",
      "Love the different boba flavors. You can see how you can order inside. It's nice you get to choose how sweet you want it. Love the oolong tea and the passion mango slush with boba.\n",
      "Great staffs, amazing drinks, super clean, very spacious with indoor/outdoor seatings and quick service! It's very easy to find parking and only 5 minutes walk from Malden Center train station. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been to this location twice for their grand opening B1G1 Promotion (pick from their Top 10 drinks). I tried earl grey milk tea with 3J's, passion fruit with green tea, matcha tea latte, pearl milk tea, strawberry latte and Taro milk tea. It's great to be able to choose the ice and sugar level. Highly recommend you to add toppings! They do make perfect tapioca pearl and the texture is perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "The guy at the cashier was very helpful explaining about the drinks and giving great recommendations. The lady that gave me the drinks was super sweet. I will definitely go back to try more drinks.\n",
      "A little pricey, but so good. Gong cha's base milk tea is so unique and delicious. The boba pearls are always perfectly cooked. The place itself is very aesthetic.\n",
      "Went for their grand opening and honestly it was not very grand. Their line was marked with blue stickers to indicate 6ft apart, but once I got there I saw everyone waiting in line clustered together. The door wasn't propped open so people waiting outside didn't even notice that it was their turn to order, and their manager didn't even have the curtesy to let them know so customers stood outside waiting even though there was nobody in front of them. Once I got inside there was no music, it was very quiet and all you could hear was the shuffling of the hard working employees. The atmosphere was not welcoming at all and there was no music either. The manager (i assume) taking the orders wasnt very welcoming when It was my turn to order, it was hard to communicate with the masks and glass but that is completely understandable. However, for a GRAND OPENING I wouldn't appreciated some more cheer and a better vibe. I understand that this place has already been open for about a week or two, but for a grand opening I expected, well, a \"grand\" opening. It was just kind of disappointing  because though there was plenty of space for customers to stay inside while maintaining social distancing, I can tell why nobody wanted to stay in that place. I saw that they were also very busy too with online orders and in person orders, so it makes sense why there was a lot of tension in the kitchen. But I feel that whoever was in charge should've done better to encourage the team and promote a better atmosphere since everyone can see the employees. Not to mention, I got their early grey milk tea from their top 10. It was definitely NOT a top 10 because I can barely taste the earl grey tea and the drink wasn't even cold ( I got regular ice). My friend got an oolong milk tea and that was very good. Overall, it was a disappointment. Not the worse, but disappointing for its opening.\n",
      "Finally got the chance to try the Malden Gong Cha location and it was pleasantly good! \n",
      "\n",
      "DRINK:\n",
      "I ordered a medium strawberry milk tea w/ pearls and it was perfectly sweet to my liking (I usually get 30% sugar w/ less ice for almost all my drinks). The pearls were also cooked very well and not hard or too soft. They definitely had the \"qq\" effect/bounce to them! \n",
      "\n",
      "SERVICE: Service was average, not too slow but also not super fast. They did have a plethora of food service orders to take care of alongside the regular walk-in orders, so no surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMBIENCE:\n",
      "This location is decently sized w/ ample outdoor seating! The location is perfect.\n",
      "Gongcha in malden just opened and one of the only places that opens late up until 11pm. I drove about half an hour just for it and this is my second time getting it since grand opening and it's still really good! I got the earl grey milk tea with pudding 50 percent sugar and less ice and it was the perfect amount of sweetness.\n",
      "I love the set up for covid! They have one entrance and one exit on opposite sides of the building so there is less contact. Though you are free to leave from the entrance I appreciated the effort. You can drink your order inside they have one little area where people were eating inside at bar type seating but only about two people (estimate because I left after receiving my order). \n",
      "Medium Brown Sugar Milk Tea (added pearls): Regular sugar and ice. This drink had a very strong roasted/toasted tea flavor and was the favorite of our order today. The milk flavor isn't too strong and for me it wasn't too sweet but if you like things less sweet I recommend 30% sugar since it does also have brown sugar. The pearls were chewy and a little harder than the boba I am used to (still great and not hard just not as soft as I am used to) great if you like chewier pearls. \n",
      "Earl Grey Milk Tea with 3 J's (Large): (30% sugar, no ice) This drink was good but had a much stronger milk taste than the Brown Sugar Milk Tea I only got the Earl Grey flavor in the aftertaste. Still great just be aware the tea flavor is more subtle. The three jellies inside were great though I personally couldn't tell a difference (not jelly educated). \n",
      "Lemon Ai-Yu White Pearl (Large): (no sugar, no ice) Very good, tasted like a juice with added jelly and pearls. Great if you like to join boba runs but don't like tea or milk (like me). Just be aware the white pearls don't have a taste and have a very different texture than the brown sugar/ regular brown boba. I would compare it to a harder/ chewier jelly more than I would boba, though it is also ~100 calories less than regular boba so maybe also good for dieters? Anyways it is great and I personally recommend this drink the most!\n",
      "When I first walked into Gong Cha, I was greeted by Jimmy and he was very friendly and was professional at taking my order and making drinks\n",
      "I came here for their soft opening today. The cashier was friendly and service was fast! We got 4 drinks: Matcha Tea Latte, Strawberry Milk Tea, Earl Grey Milk Tea with 3 J's, and Pearl Milk Tea. All were delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "This location is also much closer to Malden Center train station than the other bubble tea places in the area so it'll be a quick stop if you want a bubble tea while waiting for your bus.\n",
      "I missed the soft opening but came here during the off hr on a Monday afternoon. I loved the interior set up. There were tables inside for customers to sit and a big Gong Cha sign for picture opp. There were also tables outside to sit. I tried something different and ordered the earl tea with three Js. Absolutely loved the drink! I couldn't taste anything special about the earl gray tea, but I was ok with it. The staff was very friendly and order came out quickly. Will def be stopping by often!\n",
      "The tea are watered down, and it's not worth it to spend 6 dollars on a watered down tea with boba. However, their service was good, they got the drink to me quicker than most. If they could keep up with the good service, but fix their drink they'll be good. But this is my opinion, since the place is new you can try it yourself.\n",
      "Me and my son enjoyed their Caramel Pearl Milk Tea and Dirty Brown Sugar and it was delicious. We will visit again, the place is clean and staff are nice as well.\n",
      "They are all really nice and quick with making 6 drink order. I've been waiting for a Gong Cha to open in Malden and I'll definitely be coming back soon. The workers are all properly wearing masks and the store is very clean\n",
      "Friendly service and the taro milk tea is tasty. Would I drive a long way to go there? Probably not, but I do like it better than that Kung Fu Tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little knock: Wiping the cups with reused towel seemed odd in the COVID days. I used my own disinfectant wipe before drinking.\n",
      "Very nice and clean place! They have indoor and outdoor seatings and the staff who took my Order was very kind!\n",
      "I go to Gong Cha Malden perhaps once a week. I always order the same item which is oolong milk tea with boba. I have to say the boba and tea quality is somehow inconsistent. Half of the time I had nice experiences. The other half of the time.... the tea tastes watery and the boba is too hard to chew. I wonder if it is because the ingredients is made by different staff? Hope the shop can make an improvement on its quality consistentency. I feel like whenever I walk into the shop, there is 50/50 chance that I might regret coming here\n",
      "There was a mix up with my order BUT a worker handled the situation very well. He listened and immediately went to fix the problem, I was happy in the end! Workers are nice and the place is very clean. I got the oolong milk tea and it was tasty :)\n",
      "Extensive menu with many delicious options to choose from. Great customer service and friendly staff. Clean and spacious seating area. Nice addition to the neighborhood!\n",
      "Always ready when I get there. Also very consistent with the drinks it always tastes exactly the s from day to day. They are the bes bubble tea shop around.\n",
      "I love it here as they open in a very convenient place close to where I live. They started off so strong but lately I noticed they are cheap as heck with their topping. Double topping looks like 1. And single topping is barely a scoop. It's so stupid that they charge customers for them but skimp out. On top of that, one of the female barista there has quite the attitude...\n",
      "New opened store right beside me. Staff is friendly but hr do not know the mechines. Iems in menu much less than the Same Gong Cha store opened in China Town（been there 3 days ago）. I am wondering are they same store LOL！\n",
      "\n",
      "Price is also little bigger ，but yea i am gona have me another 1 trow. Prob not been there anymore\n",
      "So good! With COVID, I have placed the orders for pick up and bam... they are ready and are perfectly prepared. Just steps away from the Malden Center MBTA stop and across Rt 60 from Stop and Shop. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am such a fan! They have milk teas, slush, shakes, various types of toppings, everything you would expect. They have a sanitizing station at the front door and a very efficient grab and go process for pre-orders. Our favorites have been the Thai tea with boba and Oreo milk tea with crumbles. Everything has been high quality and delicious.  Highly recommend! \n",
      "\n",
      "Very clean, efficient staff, beautiful layout. Definitely worth a try- guaranteed you'll be hooked!\n",
      "I came here during grand opening - buy one get one free from their top 10! The line wrapped around the corner; however, took no more than 5-10 minutes. There's blue tape on the ground to remind customers to stay 6ft apart, though, customers did not follow such rules. The door remained closed until the previous customer finished his/her order. As there's no employee at the front of the store, customers are uncertain when to enter. I could not locate the top 10 menu until I entered the shop. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was greeted by the cashier - he was very friendly. I ordered 4 drinks: Matcha Tea Latte, Earl Grey Milk Tea with 3J's and two Milk Foam Dirty Brown Sugar Milk Tea. I personally did not enjoy the matcha tea latte as it contained a lot of powder and was very diluted. The earl grey milk tea with 3J was good, though, couldn't taste the earl grey. On the other hand, the milk foam dirty brown sugar milk tea was my favorite - very similar to the brown sugar boba ice cream bar! Next time, I would probably ask for extra ice because I got regular ice in all four drinks and they were all warm (even after mixing).\n",
      "\n",
      "This location is walking distance from the Malden Center train station. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is both indoor and outdoor seating available.\n",
      "I came for their grand opening and I'm a fan. Of all the chain bubble tea places- I like Gong Cha the best. Its all about being able to customize your drinks- love that I can get less sugar since its already a pretty sweet drink. My go-to is the Taro milk tea with boba, but everything else I've tried is good! A welcome addition to a mall that appears on the brink of dying.\n",
      "Newly opened up location! Staffs were friendly. This place is located inside of Cambridge side galleria food court. Along with Panda Express and Taco Bell, this food court is one of my favorites.\n",
      "Sooo yummy! Try the brown sugar milk tea! I went today for the first time and will definitely go back\n",
      "Loved it for a quick boba fix. They have so many flavor combos. It's also conveniently located within CambridgeSide mall, so that's fun too\n",
      "Serving more 'tude than drinks. Requested that my drink be made drinkable with a straw from the half blended slush they attempted to put in a cup. Instead of \"sure, no problem\", I literally had to figure with them for five minutes to get them to make the drink the way that I requested. Once they did agree to make the drink it the way I requested, the girl working there refused to acknowledge me or speak to me. Won't go back\n",
      "It's a pretty average bubble tea store. I got the pearl milk tea with 30% sugar and less ice. I would rate it on the higher end of the bubble tea available in the Boston/Cambridge/Somerville area. The location is also convenient because it's inside a mall so you can grab one while you shop.\n",
      "My go-to drink at Gong Cha is an earl grey milk tea with 3J. After one bad experience, I decided to give it another try -- it was a bad idea. Again, my drink was diluted. He voluntarily remade the drink, however, left it aside instead of trashing it. He said he would add more tea to the new drink..same issue. I eventually gave up and told him it's okay because I genuinely think there was an issue with the amount of substance he used.\n",
      "Proud to be the first to review this new Gong Cha, because I've been waiting for basically half a year! I come to CambridgeSide often and been looking forward to this grand opening. So this week I dropped by and surprisingly discovered that it finally is. First time I got a brown sugar ginger (warm, not burning hot). The cashier was nice and attentive, making conversation with the customers around me. The wait wasn't too long. Second time I went was today. I got an Earl Grey tea latte, and a taro milk slush. The Earl Grey's consistent with what I've had at other GC locations. And even though there were 5 customers ahead of me in line, and more who already ordered and were waiting for their drink, my drinks were made super fast, as opposed to some Kung Fu Tea experiences I've had. Oh also they have a coconut series, and dirty brown sugar series, as well as some other specials (not shown on the regular menu). I am going to try the strawberry matcha green tea latte next time. I hope the service keeps up this way.\n",
      "Might be one of the better bubble tea options in Boston. Pretty large menu with a variety of drinks and toppings to choose from. What I appreciated the most was you getting to control how much sugar goes in to your drink (same goes for ice). I tried the brown sugar ginger milk tea with boba and it was very good. Definitely interested in trying the other drinks on the menu.\n",
      "After knowing about this location last year, I was sooo excited to drop by and see what it's all about. It's tiny, but that's usually the order-and-go mindset Gong-cha has. \n",
      "If you're looking for seating, there's a bench at the front and it's conveniently located next to the food court. And best of all, it's inside of the Galleria Mall, so you can grab your drink and shop (or not shop, if you're only there for the bubble tea)! \n",
      "\n",
      "I did have to wait to be recognized by one of the workers. They were all busy making drinks. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered my usual, pearl milk tea with regular everything (70% sugar level, normal ice), and it was a little sweet. My sister got the same drink and she couldn't stop talking about how good it was. +10 points to the barista who made it really well!! To the male barista who made our drinks, you've gained two happy customers. We're definitely dropping by again!\n",
      "I had been order 8today by yelp.they're shipped only 7 and still charged me for 8.it was happening last.Feel so bad.I would never go back here.I called 3 times to ask NO one answered.\n",
      "Coming from New City, I've been a consistent fan of the main chains like Kung Fu Tea, CoCo, Ten Ren and others. But I heard of this place from a friend after they opened in Cambridge. I'm impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has become my go-to bubble tea spot in Cambridge so I'm usually here 1-2 times a week. It's also in the Cambridge Galleria mall so lots of shops and places to eat around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely recommend this place as some of the best bubble tea in Boston.\n",
      "The staff were pretty quick but the sugar level here seems super high since I always order 50% and it tasted like 100%. Light ice also seemed like 110% ice so not sure if they thought that would balance that out. But also since they were rushing, there was a lot of the drink on the outside and the label was a little wonky. We were the only customers so there was no need to rush.\n",
      "Might be one of the better bubble tea options in Boston. Pretty large menu with a variety of drinks and toppings to choose from. What I appreciated the most was you getting to control how much sugar goes in to your drink (same goes for ice). I tried the brown sugar ginger milk tea with boba and it was very good. Definitely interested in trying the other drinks on the menu. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a star off. Stopped by for the hot ginger milk tea which came out room temperature. Asked them if they could make it hotter and the server got defensive insisting it was hot. His colleague stepped in and went about making another one all the while the other person was loudly protesting. Super unprofessional and didn't look like anyone senior was around to step in and get things back on track.\n",
      "I clearly asked a medium Taro milk tea and I verified if it comes with green tea or black tea. Cashier/he told me I could get either one, so I chose green tea. Addition to that, this place wasn't busy at all. However, they gave me a medium, plain green milk tea and when I told the cashier that I ordered Taro milk tea (green), he kept insisting me that this is what I ordered. It was after work and I didn't want to argue over $5 drink, but hey what a service! My review is not about what I ordered or what they sell, but this is about that employee's attitude! I am sure such things happen everywhere. I expected something friendly. How about offering me to make the correct one?\n",
      "The tea and drinks are good!! The boba............\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like Massachusetts can't do bubble tea right. I'm a California snob after all.\n",
      "Left my hiatus from posting yelp reviews for this place. Delicious tea, honestly I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a matcha green tea latte with milk foam, 50% sweet level. It's up there with the best milk teas I've tried! If you're walking around and want a refreshment, this is the place to go.\n",
      "Horrible bubble tea...the bubble is over cook taste so bad I can't eat it  I order 30%sugar taste no sugar no flavor!!! I would not go back\n",
      "It's a good thing that this place wasn't opened earlier because they would've taken all my money. Gong Cha has a lot of good options and they have a great location in Cambridgeside. The workers seem like they're a bit overwhelmed so you might have to wait a bit. However, everything that I've tried so far has been great.\n",
      "Ordered the taro milk tea and the taro was so sour. It definitely went bad and they still served it to us. Never again.\n",
      "I can't pass up bubble tea and this was new to me found near the food court at the mall. Very nice location. Lots to choose from including two kinds of jellies. I went with an earl grey tea with herbal jelly instead of boba. No line so it was made quickly. The tea was amazing. So refreshing. I was just okay with the jelly, by the end the herbal flavor was a bit much. I prefer a fruitier jelly but they only had coconut and herbal and I didn't think coconut would go well with the earl grey. Definitely a very nice drink and great price - really wish we had one close by as they had several flavors I wanted to try.\n",
      "Great well socially distanced Gong Cha location inside Cambridgeside Galleria. The staff are blocked by a huge plastic panel with a small section so you can hand them your credit card/ money. They also take Apple Pay. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I arrived, there was a short line with everyone standing on a socially distanced sticker to ensure that people weren't packed together. The line moved pretty quickly and I managed to get my drink in around 5min. Everyone waiting for their drinks were spread out so there was plenty of space to wait without feeling like you were breathing in other peoples germs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually get the strawberry milk tea but today I decided to go with the mango green tea with coconut jelly. Such a refreshing drink for a hot day like today! The coconut jelly is 50c as compared to the white pearls which are 75c. In my opinion, the texture of these two are pretty similar, both being a little chewy and sweet. The main difference to me is their shape, so I decided to go with the coconut jelly today. The mango green tea is pretty sweet so if you don't eat dessert often, I'd recommend getting less sugar.\n",
      "No Straw. No respond to calls. Please read this review.\n",
      "Bubble teas are hard to enjoy without straws...\n",
      "This location is inside the Cambridgeside galleria mall by the food court. I was super excited for it to open cause it's so close to my apartment? It's brand spanking new and has an open store front unlike most gong chas which can be very claustrophobic. The staff is extremely nice and drinks are made solid.\n",
      "Boba drinks are below average. So powdery. I don't understand whats the powdery stuff --- btw, I ordered the green milk tea with the milk foam. All six of the drinks are powdery  Its nasty to intake the powdery stuff. Is it old milk foam?! Sorry, not coming back. Surprised it still has the financial backup for the stores opening in Ca.\n",
      "I love coming here for milk tea with boba. It's great that you can customize the amount of ice and sweetness in your drink. The cashiers are always patient and nice. I'm so excited this location opened up!\n",
      "Great location and just opened in the past week.  The menu screens are clear and the cashier is very honest about their products.  They have a BOGO deal happening (3/29-3/31) and offer a variety of drinks available for people to choose.  I wanted to drink the lemon aiyu, but unfortunately that was not one of the BOGO deals.  The strawberry green tea has a strong tea taste that I am pleasantly surprised by.  I would it drink again and the strawberry flavor was not overwhelming.  Service is prompt and the drinks are made quickly.  It is very close to the front entrance on the first floor and near the front of the food court.\n",
      "It would have been a 5 star if the girl worker with the very long ponytail hair had better customer service. She gave a very bad attitude and we did nothing but ask a little question when no line behind us. When my friend ask a question, she just rush us and didn't even act in a professional manner. Even my friends that went hours after had a complaint with the same girl. They really need to train the employees.\n",
      "I go to gongcha every other week or so. It gets crowded at night and the line can be pretty confusing when they have lots of customers. Taro milk tea is always amazing, but sometimes I get wrong orders so I ask staffs for help and they are always very accommodating.\n",
      "Stop. Just don't bother. I was so disappointed in this place that I had to get a refund after one sip. On a hot summer day I figured a strawberry lemonade would be light & refreshing. Well I was certainly mistaken. It was like liquid sugar & was simply disgusting. Although this was the only time I had been here to order something I expected better. There are so many things listed on this menu it's so overwhelming, there's a whole chart just on how to order your beverage. I basically had to find options that were vegan & certainly did but definitely not what I was expecting. I found out what they use is syrups, which of course is different than using real lemons & strawberries. I will just get bubble tea from the only place I have been over the years. My Thai in Chinatown.\n",
      "Meh. Had a basic jasmine green tea with boba light sugar and no ice here. Bubbles were a weird texture like they'd been sitting out and re-hardened.... very unpleasant. I've heard stories of the boba being better for my friends on other occasions but I dissuaded to bring my business here if I cannot be promised consistency like other bubble tea shops. Kind of a shame because its the only one in the area besides Abide, which is really just a hipster version of bubble tea. The only other places are as far as newbury/Chinatown and in the other direction, davis Square. Not sure why cambridge is such a bubble tea wasteland...\n",
      "There are so many ways to customize your bubble tea and so many options to chose from. I think many people just opt for their favorites or the most popular bubble tea for this location. It's overwhelming to try to pick from their large menu but it's awesome that they have such a large variety. \n",
      "\n",
      "This location is a stall in the CambridgeSide Galleria Mall. It's at the entrance of the mall food court. Our large bubble tea was $7. This is a good bubble tea with good quality ingredients\n",
      "Stopped by at this spot to get some refreshment from walking around the city. I usually get the mango green tea  but this time I tried the mango milk slush which was pretty good. I would love to get it again when I stop by. I usually go when I'm not in a hurry since the lines are mostly long. So it takes time ordering depends on how busy they are plus you have to wait to make the drink as well. But it's worth the wait so I don't mind. \n",
      "Would love to come back and try other drinks on the menu that I haven't tried yet so far.\n",
      "We tried the Mango Yogurt and the Mango Green Tea with the coconut jelly. The Mango yogurt is not a yogurty or milky drink -see picture, but it is sweet and tasted. I ordered the Mango Green Tea 50% sweet and it was perfect for me - not too sweet. The tea was nice and strong.  We liked the Mango fruit pieces in the drinks. It was our first time trying these boba Ike drinks. Overall they were good. Next time I'd get a large. There were so many coconut jelly pieces that I couldn't really get a lol of the tea. I'd  recommend the large if you want more tea/are thirsty.\n",
      "My favorite boba place in Chinatown! Good qualities tea and boba and lots of variety. I really like their caramel milk tea and milk foam green tea.  There's not really seating available though, so more of a grab and go place.\n",
      "This isn't necessarily the best milk tea in the world, but overall, it's decent and I like it better than the ChaTimes and Kung Fu Teas. I have never been a huge fan of KF Tea even though so many of my friends love it. I think Gong Cha, TeaDo, and Infusion Tea (when it was open) are the best ones in Boston. I like that Gong Cha has a reward system. You give them a phone number and each time, before you order, you ask them to look you up with the phone number. Over time, you can use whatever dollar amount you've accrued on your next purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tea isn't the strongest, and I like mine strong, but it's fine. I love the grass jelly. It tastes like real grass jelly. The ones at KF Tea don't taste exactly right to me. I also prefer regular black tea for milk tea rather than the KF Tea blend. It's not authentic Taiwanese taste to me. The brown sugar milk tea, and the earl grey milk tea w/ 3Js are great too. Bobas are generally good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I've tried that I think is better at Kung Fu tea is the matcha slush with red bean. Other than that, I much prefer Gong Cha's options. I can't wait for the Allston location to open up soon.\n",
      "Gong Cha is currently my favorite place for bubble tea at the moment in Chinatown. It beats out Chatime and Teado fro sure. And they have way more options than all the bubble tea shops that I've been to. So far I am loving their milk teas. Everything tastes great. The only thing that I would stay far, far away from is their white pearl. I cannot stand it. It's texture is unlike the regular pearls and it somehow makes me feel like I'm chewing on cartilage.\n",
      "The milk tea here is actually really good if you're willing to wait.  We got there at 10pm on a Saturday night and there was a line out the door.  Took about 25 minutes altogether.  I ordered the milk foam brown sugar oolong, which was delicious.  I'll probably get less sugar and add white boba next time.\n",
      "Seriously, took 30 min to buy 2 drinks.  Only 1 person making tea and 1 to take order.  The line is less than 10 people.  Had to ask the second person to help to make the drink.\n",
      "  Never again.\n",
      "I've been a couple of times since opening but not any time recently. I have tried Gong Cha in NYC, Cali, and Canada and I think it's just this specific store that I'm iffy about. The only drink that I liked was the panda milk tea but it was just okay. The milk foam wintermelon was very weak and I couldn't really taste the milk foam. I have tried my friends drinks too and they were either way too sweet or lacked flavor. I really don't understand why there is always such a long line out the door for subpar boba when there's plenty of better boba places nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in the 2-3 times I've actually been inside to either get something for myself or wait with a friend, the wait is close to 20 minutes and they are ALWAYS out of something. Out of Thai tea, out of boba (like what... you're a boba shop?!) - it's ridiculous. They also misheard my friend on several of her orders and my friend was just so frustrated with it that she just kept the order as is. Lastly, they double charged me on a large order and when I called about it they were just like \"oh... just come in and show us your statement and we'll give you your money back. We can't see old transactions.\" I just didn't bother going back so I disputed the transaction on my card but, jeez, this place needs better service.\n",
      "So exciting to see a Gongcha open up in Chinatown! The best quality bubble tea you can find around here. The regular milk tea has an amazing taste that's not too milky or too sweet, but just right! I'm a big fan of toppings in my drink, so rightfully the Earl grey tea with bubbles, herbal jelly, and pudding is definitely one of my favorite drinks!\n",
      "I'm not too sure what the hype is for this, I didnt even try the gong cha in NY to compare this to. I did not go during the opening weekend for the BOGO because the wait was ridiculous and it was cold outside. I got the passion fruit green tea without the boba, less ice and 70% sugar, which I  thought was the perfect sweetness for me, if it was at 100% sweetness I think it might have been too sweet. I also recommend the milk foam green tea. \n",
      "\n",
      "The interior is what killed me, there is not much space, just a bench that goes along the windows able to seat about 5 people and the rest would have to stand in this little area to wait for the their drink and make a swift exit when they call your number. The wait in total to make the drink was about 20 minutes, but to be fair, they only had 3 people--one to take orders, and 2 to make the drinks, so it is understandable for the delay. \n",
      "\n",
      "Coming here is definitely something that I will do in the future, maybe when the hype dies down a bit more so I don't have to wait for 30 minutes to get a drink.\n",
      "After the craze of the Buy One Get One dissipated, the lines at Gong Cha are slowlyyyyyyyy disappearing. I can't tell if it's the weather or the hype that is causing this but anyways... I have tried the lemon aiyu, pearl milk tea, green tea with milk foam, and taro milk tea. Of the drinks, I do have to say their teas are of a high standard (I come here for the green tea with milk foam alot) and my first choice for grabbing bubble tea in Chinatown. Funny story: One of the old owners from Juice Bar told me when they were closing up shop in May that a mainlander purchased the location for a chain. I guessed Gong Cha took up the spot. Boy, was that a lucky guess.\n",

      "IG: Mood4foodeatery\n",
      "Definitely a huge let down. I've been to several Gong Cha locations around the world and was very excited when I found out Boston was to be getting its own location. I went on opening weekend for the BOGO offer but each of the 4 drinks I ordered was a disappointment. I hoped that this was just a result of them being super busy during the time and decided I would come back at another time to give them another try. I went back two weeks later and ordered the same drinks. They were again very disappointing and pale in comparison to their California, New York, and Asia locations. I'll be sticking to the Kungfu Tea around the block.\n",
      "Gong cha has finally come! I would always get their milk tea with boba when in New York and once when I was in Korea. This is located where juice bar used to be/ across the street from beard papa.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can choose your ice and sugar level.\n",
      "Regular sugar is 70%, I like to go with 50% when ordering the milk tea.\n",
      "Other drinks to try: earl gray milk tea and green tea foam!\n",
      "\n",
      "They are open today at 11AM- 11PM for their BOGO Nov 9-12 selective 5 drinks only. Check out the picture I posted.\n",
      "Gong cha is my favorite tea chain to grab a drink at when in Asia. I was super excited about a store opening up in Boston but it really can't compare. I ordered my favorite hot taro milk tea and was unpleasantly surprised. The taro flavor they use at this store comes from a poor quality, artificial powder. :(\n",
      "Gong Cha is another great addition to local bubble tea places. They are small and not really a place for hanging out, but they make really great drinks. They have several unique offerings -- like the brown sugar tea, ginger tea, and basil seed topping. I'm also quite partial to their mousse, which is very savory and salty and a perfect pair for sweet tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most other places, they allow you to customize your sugar and ice levels, and add pretty much any topping you want (for a fee). The service is very speedy and friendly.\n",
      "Gong Cha is definitely one of my go-to boba locales in California, but this one isn't the same. On a Friday night, the line was out the door; granted, it's a small shop. The service is pretty quick though so don't let this affect you. \n",
      "\n",
      "-EARL GREY MILK TEA: I usually get this with herb jelly but the earl grey flavor is definitely lacking. To be honest, it just tasted like a regular milk tea with herb jelly (which is still tasty).\n",
      "-MILK CREAM GREEN TEA: I don't prefer this here because I'm partial to salt creama. There isn't anything special to the milk cream either. The first time I got it, the tea flavor was watered down. The second time, we asked for extra sugar (extra: 100%, regular: 70%) but tasted even blander.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was happy to find a Gong Cha in Boston, this was rather disappointing. I have to say that it does satisfy boba cravings if you happen to be nearby.\n",
      "My favorite boba chain is finally open and I'm so happy to say it meets expectations!! You'll prob never see me at another boba chain in Chinatown again. \n",
      "\n",
      "BOGO until 11/12! There's basically only space for ordering to go, a window bench for 3-4 ppl to sit at most. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the tea! Not too sweet, so 100%-70% is not a problem, compared to uber sweetness at some other chain. Prices are not bad either, $3.75 for medium milk tea with boba. Definitely coming back to try other menu items.\n",
      "Gong cha is one of my favorite milk tea stores when I was still in the Philippines. Whenever I go to NYC, I always try to visit their store in Chinatown. I'm so glad they opened here in Boston. For this tea shop, I would recommend getting any tea with cheese foam.\n",
      "One of the best tea places in town, try their milk tea with red bean at 30% sugar and/or their winter melon drink with ai-yu at 30% sugar! So, so good!\n",
      "I rate Gong Cha a three star because the boba is good the drink is good but the service is not. After i orders my bubble tea drink which was qq passion fruit one server made the drink and the others just went on their phones. The drink was still good though so if you are looking for a good drink you can head there but be aware of the bad customer service.\n",
      "earl grey milk tea with 3j's!!!! Order it, thank me later. burp.\n",
      "Tried to purchase tea here twice but the lines were always too long. They need to hire more staff to get the lines moving. I opted for another bubble tea place. I'll go back and try Gong Cha once they are fully staffed.\n",
      "Got my order wrong (ordered a medium, not a large) and there is something very suspicious on my lid (mold maybe??)\n",
      "Waited for more than 1h30mins just to get Bubble Tea which is insane but I was waiting it's opening for so long. Recommend their Milk Foam but better no sugar or it'll be too sweet (from what I think)\n",
      "I have a palate that enjoys the tea flavor and less syrup/fruity ones so my review is based on the black tea with milk (caramel and brown sugar). I also like that you can customize your drink based on sugar percentages (30, 50, 70%, etc).  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the two times that I have been here, the lines were out the door. It can also get hot in the small area while waiting for your drinks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would come back but only if I have at least 20 min to spare.\n",
      "I went here on Opening Weekend and they were having a promotion where 5 different drinks off their menu were buy 1 get 1 free. Thus, it only cost a little over $4 for 2 drinks. The store is very small with no tables and only a bench for seating. It was very busy and felt cramped with 25 people in it. \n",
      "\n",
      "We all ordered the Pearl Bubble Tea since it was the only one that was part of the promotion that we were interested in. On their menu, they also have the mustache series Pearl bubble tea which is very popular now-a-days. The bubble tea was good and their tapioca balls were soft. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I felt the quality was a little better than Teado or Chai Time. Note that it's a small place so there's really no room to hang out and it's just an order and go kind of place.\n",
      "The place is cramped and there isn't any room to sit and chill (besides one bench parallel to the register) BUT the customer service is really great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The works are very friendly and willing to accommodate to you. One worker added pearls to my tea even though it was my fault for not being completely clear in my order. No complaints either! He was very understanding and quick to take action.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the Earl Grey Milk Tea, 50% sweetness with light ice and pearls. My sister got the peach green tea with pearls and she enjoyed it. It's more refreshing. My other sister got a slushy, which was good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this place!\n",
      "Having tried Gong Cha for the first time in New York and loving it, I was so excited to see this location open up. My go-to drink is always the plain milk tea with tapioca, and this place can always be counted on for its consistency in quality and taste. The tapioca are cooked perfectly in that they aren't too chewy or mushy. In addition, the level of customization is much appreciated, from specifying sugar level, ice level, and even drink temperature. For those with a more adventurous palate, feel free to add in other mix-ins such as egg pudding or milk foam for an additional fee. Unfortunately this is more of a walk-in place as seating is limited to a small bench where most people wait for their beverages. \n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure to join their loyalty program as well by giving them your phone numbers. After 10 drinks, you get a free one!\n",
      "The line is always long, shop is small and crowded. So far I tried the milk foam green tea which is worth the hype and wait. The milk foam oolong tea is ok, wouldn't get it again. And the taro milk tea is just nasty (do not get!).\n",
      "The is now my favorite milk tea boba place.  How's it different from the other places?  The varieties Gong Cha carries and the quality of the ingredients.  It's no wonder that on any given day there is a line outside with well dressed Asian students waiting for tea.  The Earl grey special with the triple filling is still my go to but I hear from my teen friends that the mango is very nice.\n",
      "The bubble tea is awesome. I would give it five stars but I hate the line. I hate the location, it's a very small store that's always crowded and they never seem to really direct the line so it's always going outside or wrapping around weirdly.\n",
      "Was decent. Service was fast during Sunday's opening. Lighter than Kungfu but thicker taste than some. I hope they can keep the consistency of quality and service. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place used to be another Hong Kong bubble tea shop called Juice Bar. Time changes a lot of things around here.\n",
      "I've never had Gong Cha but heard it was supposed to be really good so I was really excited for it to open! \n",
      "\n",
      "I went during their BOGO event and got the regular milk tea with boba and green tea with milk foam. I got regular sugar levels to test out how sweet their drinks were (I think their regular sugar levels are 70% sugar). Their regular milk tea with regular sugar is pretty sweet and I think 50% or 30% would be good. Get the milk foam! The milk foam with 70% sugar was JUST right. It wasn't too sweet but it also wasn't too bland. I also loved the hint of salt in the drink! I tried my friend's green tea milk foam with 30% sugar and you CAN taste the difference! They really follow through and give you the percentage of sugar you requested. I've been to a couple of places where 30% is the same as 100% sugar so I was happy that Gong Cha actually makes the effort to follow through your requests.\n",
      "Yay! Gong Cha chain is finally in Boston! This place is small and will be busy during peak times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of options of different flavor milk tea, tea, coffee, and drinks. The boba I had in my drink was not sweetened or at least I could not tell it was sweetened. The milk tea flavor was good, tasted natural and not from a powder. There is extensive customization to make exactly how sweet or the amount of ice you want in your drink. The default seems to be 70% sweet on the sweetness level. You will be asked this when ordering. If you have not had this level of customization in your milk tea drinks then it might take a few drinks before you dial in your preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far my favorite is the earl grey milk tea with 3J's (I think this mean 3 types of jellies = boba, pudding, grass jelly)\n",
      "\n",
      "I will be back to try more of their menu. The prices are on par with other milk tea places. About $4 to $5 depending on the amount of add ins and size.\n",
      "It's my second time in visiting this place, first time I got some fruity tea and this time I tried the caramel milk tea. And my friend got the coffee milk tea. My caramel milk tea was fine, wasn't really impressed about it. But my friend was disappointed of her coffee she tried it back in Vietnam and she said it was good but in Boston she said it was gross and super watery and they didn't give her ice on her drink so she had to go back and ask the lady for ice on her drink. We might have ordered not so good drinks but maybe someday we'll come back for something else.\n",
      "Came here twice, and both times lines were out the door! Waited about ~15 minutes to place an order and then about another 5 for them to make it. There is no seating inside. I came by with a friend and wanted a nice place to sit and chat, but the inside was packed with people waiting for their drinks. I tried the white pearl milk tea. The white pearls were definitely unique. It had a more chewy, almost aloe like texture. I originally expected it to be the same as the black pearls but in white but it is definitely different. I love the place for their bubble tea but the lack of seating and the interior vibe takes away a star. You basically come to get your drink and leave right away as there is no room to even stand a minute longer with the amount of people.\n",
      "Great bubble tea, bad location. I like how you can customize what percentage of sugar and such you want, but the place is very small and service is slow. Last time i went, the place was very dirty and the trash can was overflowing, with garbage all over the floor. It was late and there was barely a line then, is it that hard to pick up the waste and empty it??\n",
      "This location is particular is tiny so this is not a good spot if you want a place to sit and hang out. They also get pretty busy so I don't recommend going near closing time, many topping and tea would run out by then. I've only gotten the earl grey milk tea with 3J and it was actually pretty good! I will most likely be back in the near future to try out other drinks on the menu.\n",
      "I've never liked those milk foam/salted cheese toppers or whatever at other bubble tea places, but after my friends suggested I try it, it's been the only thing I get.\n",
      "\n",
      "My order of choice is a Winter Melon Milk Foam with pudding (lowkey better than boba) with slightly less ice. Mix up the foam with with drink then you have a delicious mix of sweet and salty that I usually only find with salted caramels.\n",
      "Gong Cha is my favorite boba shop and I go as often as I can. Their drinks are delicious. I love the fruity teas and highly recommend the QQ Passion Fruit Green Tea (boba with coconut jelly). \n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that one of the employees makes awful tea. Every drink I've gotten from this employee is bitter, over-steeped, and nasty. They also forget to add the sweet pieces of fruit that come in the fruit-flavored drinks. I've had the same drink (with same sugar and ice level) made by this employee and another and they tasted completely different.   \n",
      "\n",
      "I also don't recommend going as soon as they open unless you want unsweetened boba.\n",
      "This is worth the wait! This boba shop is always poppin' and has a line running all the way to the next store. I came here twice, one for the BOGO free during their grand opening and another time during the weekday. I waited over an hour during their BOGO and it was totally worth it. The other time, I believe I waited for about 20 minutes. I tried the milk foam series (green tea, oolong, and earl grey) and their original milk tea.  I remember the milk foam teas were $3.75 for a medium whether you add boba or not. Every one of them was SOOO GOOD; very creamy, satisfies my sweet tooth, and blends in really well with the tea. I like to alter my drink to 50-75% sweetness so that the sweetness doesn't override the tea. There are some drinks that can be made vegan by switching milk to a plant-based one. I can't wait to go back and try other flavors!\n",
      "Don't get the hype. Only thing that was good was the boba. I got milk tea and my boyfriend taro slush. My first time here and you can never go wrong with milk tea. We got normal (70%) sugar and normal ice. It tasted like water with a tablespoon of sugar. How do you mess up milk tea???? I don't get it. Even the taro slush tasted the same. I couldn't tell there was any taro in it. We actually took one sip of our drink and then threw it away lmao. We decided to go to Teado right after cause they usually don't disappoint that hard. I felt sad drinking Gong Cha's milk tea\n",
      "I prefer Gong Cha over Chatime or Tea Do and Kung Fu Tea is a huge no-no (their pearls always taste hyper-sugary and artificial from too long of a syrup soak). The pearls at Gong Cha when I've gone are a consistent chewy texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milk tea with Pearls is tasty and not bland, like at most other places.  Today I tried their Milk Foam Oolong Tea with pearls and it was better than I expected! I've had Milk Foam Green Tea in Taiwan and didn't like it then, so I'm glad I tried it here because it wasn't too salty and made the drink creamier. I actually saw the worker prepping a new batch of foam and she mixed Lactaid milk with pre-made packages of some sort of dried milk powder. So their drinks may be dairy-free?\n",
      "\n",
      "This shop is tiny though, so every time I've gone I've had to wait a good 10-15 minutes to order and get my drinks. I also provide them with my phone number for rewards and noticed both times that the cashier just writes down the number on a sticky note and doesn't seem to register it into the system, so it's questionable what they do with the info and if I'm actually getting points for my purchases.\n",
      "I am a regular here. I love gongcha. They have so many good drinks but bad service. Specifically, the cashier kept playing with his phone while taking orders. Ended up making wrong orders. Didn't say apologize to the customer. Manager should take more time to train him better.\n",
      "This place is alright. To be honest, with so many milk tea shops opened in Boston I don't even know which one is better than the another. They all tasted the same and look the same. This shop is smaller compares to Chatime, Kung fu tea, Happy Lemon  and Tea Do. But they all sell the same drinks on the menu. The only difference about this shop is they got the white pearls as the topping that no other milk tea shops in Boston have. The pearls are very chewy and taste delicious. Services is fast and the line could be right out the door at time.\n",
      "I was excited to go here but it was disappointing.  1) they put in a lot of sugar when I asked for none 2) they got my friends order wrong 3) then we waited another 20 minutes to get my other friends drink because they ran out of hot water.  So yaaaaa... maybe not again.\n",
      "The bubble milk tea was good along with the lemon ai yu drink.  The Lemon ai yu came with clear white boba and some clear white jelly (more for texture than for taste).  The bubble milk tea was not too sweet and drinks can be customized to your liking.\n",
      "I got the Taro milk tea with tapioca pearls and coconut jelly. The service was fast and the cashier was welcoming and sweet. I got 70% sugar and regular ice and it was delicious!\n",
      "Waited for 40+ mins and I have mix feelings about the drinks. I ordered both the pearl milk tea and the milkfoam green tea. The pearl milk tea was so bland and the pearl (boba) were too firm. I had high expectations since this drink was in the Top 10 but was left disappointed. However the milkfoam green tea which is also in the Top 10 was awesome. The green tea flavor was strong which I love and the milk foam on top was rich, creamy, almost buttery tasting. I highly recommend the milkfoam green tea and I would definitely comeback to try other milkfoam drinks. Hopefully the milk tea will improve once this crazy opening weekend is over.\n",
      "Relatively small space but many options for boba and many variations for what you can do! I had the QQ passionfruit green tea the last time I went which came with coconut jelly and boba and it was delicious. I also love that you can adjust both the amount of sugar and ice in your drink - would highly recommend. Warning that there might be a line though as it was nearly out the door when I was last there!\n",
      "Was it worth waiting in 30 degree weather for 20 minutes while I wait for wintergreen tea with white boba?\n",

      "Was it worth it knowing that it replaced my favorite local bubble tea shop in Chinatown? \n",
      "\n",
      "Was it worth almost 5 dollars?\n",
      "\n",
      "As much as I hate to admit it, yeah, it was. I'm not a fan of all the chains coming here to Chinatown but I can't be too mad at Gong Cha; they deliver.\n",
      "great tasting bubble tea (and I've been to A LOT of boba places). Fair warning, this is a tiny cramped place. You go in, order your stuff, and then leave. There is only a small bench for waiting space, but this is a very popular joint and there was a line out the door both times I came. It is in the middle of Chinatown, and a famous name, so it's not surprising that they have good business. I hope they can expand to another location one day, one with tables and seats.\n",
      "I don't know- I am just okay with this place. It was wayyyy too hyped up and the lines make it really unbearable to wait because there are so many more options around the block. It's such a small shop that it's so awkward and you can't even see the menu or top ten until you get to the register. The waiting area is super tight. I thought there was ten people ahead of me waiting but they were just sitting there chatting- which is usually fine but there is LITERALLY NO ROOM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also I got the royal milk tea with boba. The price point is right, it's on the cheaper side compared to other boba places but it tasted like dirty water. Maybe I'll go again and try something else .\n",
      "I've always wanted to try this place out ever since it first open but the line is always out the door. The line may be long but it moves pretty fast. There are so many new boba tea place opening but I like how they add their own spin on boba tea drinks with the milk foam. It's unique and defiantly delicious, I love the creaminess it adds on to the drinks. The menu can get a bit overwhelm so the top 10 does help a lot. I ordered the milk foam green tea, the aiyu tea, the mango yogurt, and they were all delicious. The only down side is the place is a bit small, no tables and a small seating to wait for your drinks that's about it. Overall it's a good place to grab a quick drink.\n",
      "Gong Cha is the place I usually go to when I craved for bubble tea in NYC. We visited Boston for a night, and we were looking for a place we could have something that we were familiar with, and I'm glad I found Gong Cha in Boston Chinatown. We ordered brown sugar milk tea with coconut jelly, 3 Js (Earl grey milk tea w grass jelly, tapioca and pudding). Remember to order half sugar if you can't stand very sweet taste.\n",
      "This place is  a hit or miss. I usually order 2/3 times a week from here because their drinks on GOOD days are so addicting. But recently for the pass couple of months there are times when my milk tea taste like water even when I've asked multiple times for 100% sugar. I had to even go back to ask for them to remake it, just to have it taste like water again. So I just gave up. I hope gong cha becomes more consistent in their drinks again.\n",
      "I ordered four MF milk teas today but there didn't have any topping on it. This kind of milk teas supposed come with milk cream topping on it, but none of them have cream topping. Maybe the waitress just forget to put the topping on my MF milk teas. So disappointed with today's service.\n",

      "Bubble tea is taking over Boston and I love that there are more options for milk tea in the area. I think Gong Cha has the best milk tea. It is smoother and less powdery tasting than Kung fu tea. It is not as sweet as tea do but creamier than cha time. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only gripe about this place is the wait. There is usually a line out the door, which I can understand because the space is tight but they could expedite the service if they were more efficient. I often see lots of drinks piled up next to the cashier waiting for the cashier to call out the recipients. It is just so slow because you're waiting for them to give you your drink rather than waiting to place your order. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although I do think they have the best milk tea in town, I wouldn't wait for one if the line was out the door. That's a guaranteed 20-30min wait.\n",
      "Worst milk tea I've ever tried. I tried Gong cha in New York and it was so good. The one in Boston is bad. I order Earl Grey milk tea with boba & pudding but they gave me white boba. Never Come Back. Kungfu tea is better\n",
      "Disappointed with Gong Cha. I hate to say that I feel the workers are very shady here. I ordered one cold and one hot drink. The cold drink came out fine, but the hot drink was only half filled. The cups for cold drinks are see through, but not hot drinks, so obviously I didn't see it was only half filled. I also didn't bother checking because I expect to get what I ordered. I didn't pay full price for half an order. Learn to do honest business.\n",
      "This is the closest a milk tea has come to my beloved Dong Khanh down the street. It's not artificially sweet like the others, but definitely doesn't taste as fresh. As someone who just likes regular milk tea with boba, I'm not too picky about flavor options. I will say the black tea here tastes more complex in a good way. The regular milk tea with boba is not too sweet and just perfectly creamy. Boba is soft and chewy. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I decided to branch out after trying my boyfriend's strawberry boba (their new flavors) and try their strawberry yogurt. What a mistake! It was overly sweet, even when I had regular sugar and ice. Definitely do not recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "As others have mentioned, this is a small location and the line can get a little wily. I would not come here if you were in a rush. Parking in Chinatown is always bad, but the cops seem slightly more lenient with double parking on this street if you are here with a friend.\n",
      "I've had a lot of Gongcha in Korea so I think fondly of the chain but definitely this location isn't the best. Not a place to sit down and chat either, which is alright but just a heads up! \n",
      "\n",
      "The tea is pretty good, but I've had better Gongcha at different locations. Still highly recommend because I love the flavors they use.\n",
      "Straight to the point, you order and you go. Lines can get ugly long but it's worth the wait. Former  Kung-Fu tea go-er now I will be making a stop here whenever I'm in Chinatown! I ordered the classic Oolong, 30% sugar, and less ice. Came out just how I wanted. Can't wait to try their other teas.  I highly recommend if you love tea as much as I do, give this place a try!!\n",
      "Get the milk foam green tea, 100% sugar and ice. Your life will be complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuff said.\n",
      "A bit of a let down IMO.  The milk foam offering, the key item for this shop to be a contender in an already saturated market of tea, was poorly executed.  Considering this was under the section \"Mustache\", one could reasonably expect an open beverage container.  Imagine my surprise when I was handed a sealed plastic cup often used for boba tea, with no access to obtaining that coveted milk foam mustache on my hungry lips.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the product?  Pros include a fairly good tea, and the customization of the sugar level down to the tenth percentage is amazing (accountant here, I love numbers).  But again, with the execution of what I would consider their KEY product being quite shit, and a line going out the door, I'm not sure if I'll readily come back.  Plus, the green tea milk foam wasn't as good as I had hoped, although that again could be blamed to the fact I had to suck it up through a straw rather than diving in and getting that stache.  For now, I'll probably stick to the sea salt creme top tea Sakura offers next door, and may gander another attempt at this place and try another beverage.  With their avid fan base, maybe I'm doing something wrong?  If so, TELL ME, cause I'd be none the wiser as it currently stands.\n",
      "The establishment is extremely small but makes up for it with the drinks -- at least the ones my friend and I had ordered. My friend ordered the Strawberry Oreo Chocolate Drink and I ordered the Dirty Brown Sugar Milk Tea. My friend swears hers reminded her of a Duvalin (type of Mexican candy). I was caught off guard with the strong flavor and thickness of the milk foam from my drink but enjoyed it once I had mixed it with the rest. The rest of the menu didn't catch my attention but I would definitely come back for the Dirty Brown Sugar series.\n",
      "Gongcha was my life when I was in Asia! So happy it's in Boston now. I found it when I was in NYC but that is too much of a trek to get bubble tea! I always order the regular milk tea and it's so delicious. Get it with 50% sweetness or less if you don't like sweet and less ice so it doesn't melt! (My perfect one is 30% sweet and less ice) There is a menu posted outside so you should know figure out your order before you get in. Shop is small but the people are nice. They take credit card so props to that. The line is long though.\n",
      "So your definitive ranking of boba/bubble tea in Boston's Chinatown is:\n",
      "1. Kung Fu Tea \n",
      "2. Gong Cha \n",
      "3. Tea Do\n",
      "\n",
      "Gong Cha is pretty average but is definitely way better than Tea Do! A plus is they open until 11pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends. Would come here if Kung Fu Tea was too packed or closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the Jasmine milk tea (or green milk tea) and liked the flavor for the most part...but thought it was a bit on the watery side. Keep in mind that 70% sweetness is the regular level of sweetness here, if you want less sweet ask for 50%. If you're crazy and like your drinks extra sweet then go for that 100%. I'm not a fan of the tapioca pearls here...they were super mushy when I went. But at least super mushy is better than hard, I guess.\n",
      "Found hair in my milk tea. Sent an email to the customer service with this pic, and there was no response at all. Never going to this place again.\n",
      "I came here on a Friday night, not crowded. The place is relatively small, no sitting area. But it's a milk tea place, meant for quick service anyway. \n",
      "Drinks are on the pricier side. But they have more options than many other places. \n",
      "No parking lot attached. But there are few parking garages near by. Street parking is also available. But good luck finding one. \n",
      "They do accept credit cards.\n",
      "A solid 4.0 for taste and expediency with order\n",
      "Note: Price is slightly higher than neighboring tea competition such as Kung Fu Tea, or Sweet Kingdom Desserts, Tea Do etc. \n",

      "Time arrived: 7:45pm Monday evening with 1 friend - no line, but probably 5 other patrons sitting on the bench in the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambience: Clean, small trashcan, bright vibrant colors, 4 servers behind the counter, short line (although in passing by here frequently this past month, typically Gong Cha has the longest of any tea places I have witnessed on average). Good Chinese Pop hits music playing in the background that was not overly loud to interrupt flow of conversation between my friend and I who happened to be the only 2 sitting down on the limited bench seating with our orders for a solid 20-30min.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service: Quick - within 5m both my friend and my own orders were ready.\n",

      "Order: original milk bubble tea - 30% sugar, regular ice\n",
      "I believe the best judgment of desserts and bubble tea is the most classic flavor, in this case the original milk bubble tea. At $4.55 with tax, I find that the size of the bubble tea is satisfying (typically my fill of tea is complete after 1/2 of the smallest size at most establishments).\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Not overly sweet (with my reduced (30%) sugar request), which did not oversensitize or dissuade me from continuing my drink. \n",
      "The bubbles themselves were soft with a good ratio of bubbles per sip.\n",
      "My friend commented that her hot wintermelon drink was indeed QUITE hot (fyi). \n",
      "\n",
      "Tips/Takeaways:\n",
      "-Price point might be 20-50 cents higher than the cheapest options in the area\n",
      "-Reduced sweetness is satisfactory\n",
      "-Service is quick when the line is short and the music/ambience is nice, although seating is limited\n",
      "-I personally enjoyed this taste and vybe better than the neighboring Kung Fu Tea down several blocks (both historically at other locations and now this being my first time trying Gong Cha, locally as well).\n",
      "-I think I personally preferred the bubble and SIZE and PRICE of tea at Sweet Kingdom Desserts down the street \n",
      "-Would recommend return 1x / 6-8 weeks for bubble tea for a variant in taste/bubbles\n",
      "Ever since my recent trip to Taiwan, the bubble tea in Boston seemed watered down and could no longer satisfy my taste buds. That's why I decided to give Gong Cha a try. I've tried the one in New York and remembered me loving it, but I forgot what I got. I had amazing brown sugar milk tea in Taiwan and have been obsessed ever since. I was very happy to see that they offered that here at Gong Cha! When I got there, the line was pretty short (compared to how it was when it first opened) and the wait was moderate. It is a very small shop, so beware if you have to wait outside the cold! The process of paying is quite slow... not sure if it is because of their system, but you stand there for quite some time in order for your card to process - not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. The brown sugar milk tea was not like the one I had in Taiwan (to my disappointment), but something about it is just as addicting so I am officially IN. LOVE. Highly recommend this - with or without boba. Not a fan of boba but their boba is amazing, but I also had the drink without boba, and to me, it was much better. Less boba equals more volume which equals more milk tea. Such a win! I will never ever stop coming here. They can take all my money!\n",
      "I got MF Green Tea. I told them to make regular one for me but it's too sweet as sugar water\n",
      "Wondering what the \"milk foam\" is?! TRY IT! Got out of my comfort zone to try the matcha milk foam green tea and it was BOMB. The tea itself is sweet and the foam at the top is a little salty..but when you mix it together, it tastes amazing! 10/10 would order it again\n",
      "Mango yogurt drink was great! Glad the lines finally died down so I could try it out..\n",
      "By far, probably the best bubble tea I ever had. I always keep it classic, having milk tea from every place offered and gong change has it the best. However, their toppings are quite horrible from what I had so far. (Except milk foam if you want to consider that as a topping) \n",
      "\n",
      "Their bubbles and grass jelly is quite horrible. But other than that, green tea with milk foam never disappoints\n",
      "I love gong cha. When I first tried this place out when they first opened I wasn't a big fan but after a couple of times I fell in love. I always get milk foam with my drinks and it's honestly the best topping ever!\n",
      "We headed to Chinatown after picking up breakfast sandwiches from Mike & Patty's nearby. There were a lot more bakeries and Vietnamese restaurants than we expected. Gong Cha was one of the better bubble tea chains in NY so we decided to go there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The line went out the door so it was about 5 minutes waiting there. After ordering, we waited another 8 minutes for our 2 drinks. Service was really nice and spoke perfect English.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered pearl milk tea with pudding with 70% sugar and less ice. They got everything done correctly for the most part! The price was typical (4.25$ for one drink) but there aren't any seats except for a small bench.\n",
      "I think I got my milk tea too early (arrived when they just opened) because my bobba were a little hard in the center. I got taro milk tea with milk foam and it was good. The foam has a salty flavor which balances out the sweet milk tea. I like that you can adjust ice and sugar here.\n",
      "Food: 4/5\n",
      "Ambiance: 4/5\n",
      "Service: 5/5\n",
      "\n",
      "Got the milk foam strawberry tea with white pearl and a strawberry milk tea on two separate occasions. Both were very good. The ambiance is typical of a small boba store, but the layout is logical and very easy and comfortable to walk through/wait in line. The service is fast and friendly. Despite its famous good boba tea, the lowered food star rating is because I always get slight stomachaches afterwards. I'm not sure if the ingredients aren't fresh or I'm especially sensitive - but points docked for that. I normally do not have that reaction at other boba stores\n",
      "I ordered oolong milk tea with milk foam. Not so satisfied with the milk foam. I rather go to Kungfu Tea for their oolong milk tea or Royaltea for their milk foams.\n",
      "I choose this place over Chai Time which is literally across the street because of Cha Time's inconsistencies between locations.  This place had a huge line up.  The tea good and consistent between locations.\n",
      "I have been drinking Gong Cha for so long. However, last Sunday, the cashier girl was kinda rude. We were ordering few drinks of black milk tea which were milk foam black tea. She said there was only black tea on foam milk, not green tea. I pointed to the menu, and she replied it doesnt matter, there is only foam milk with black tea, you should know that!!!!!??????\n",
      "Then we ordered passion fruit with green tea, and the cashier girl talking while putting order and looking at screen: again, green and black are the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, the drink are still good as usual. Good job Gong Cha, except that cashier girl.\n",
      "Make me homesick...there are plenty of choices. I really hope that there can be one near where I live!\n",
      "My friend and I came here opening weekend and took advantage of the BOGO offer. There were 5 or 6 drinks that qualified for that offer. You can also get them either hot or cold. We got 2 hot drinks because it was freezing that day. We waited @~25-30 minutes and I think it was pretty worth it. I've had Gong Cha before in Australia and I really enjoyed it, so I was pretty excited to see that they finally made their way to Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a hot pearl milk tea with boba and my friend got a hot mango green tea with coconut jelly. Hopefully as time passes, the line won't be as long. Another thing I like about Gong Cha is that they have a lot more drink offerings than the standard boba joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will definitely come back when I'm in the Chinatown area!\n",
      "This place is always packed with a long line. I finally got a chance to come. I had taro milk tea with pearl. It's made by powder and tasted very artificial. 30% sugar level was so sweet, probably the sweetest 30% I've ever had. Pearls were cooked well. \n",
      "Price is on the high end. Won't come back.\n",
      "Have been here twice in the last month and really like the drinks here. This place is tiny though, a walk in and order situation and a very tight waiting area with a long window ledge for some people to sit. No tables. I especially like how they have non-milk / non- tea options for those with allergies, and even substitute soy milk upon request. I ordered most recently matcha milk green tea (hot) and sparkling lychee drink with light ice. Staff totally fine with Mandarin or English. Recommend.\n",
      "Was in Boston for the weekend with my family. We ordered a medium thai milk tea with coconut jelly and a medium taro milk tea with white pearls. They were very good, but the coconut jelly was hard to suck up with my straw. Maybe next time I will get tapioca or white pearls, as they are easier to suck up with the straw. Overall, I love Gong Cha. It's easily the best boba tea spot in the Boston area, and I always try to make a stop to Gong Cha whenever I'm in Chinatown. Highly recommend the taro!\n",
      "Yum! Had the Taro Milk slushie. They gave me a choice of sweetness,  30, 50 and 70 and said 70 was \"standard\". I ordered 50 and it was still really sweet.  The line was long (out the door on a Sunday night) but the wait after I ordered wasn't terrible.\n",
      "One of the most highly talked about bubble tea places in Boston, Gong Cha lives up to its reputation. They have a wide variety of drinks, teas, smoothies, shakes etc. Of course I am not a big fan of actual bubble tea, but rather I enjoy drinking the slushees/icees in particular Taro. I love that you can request that your drink here be less sweet (25-75% of its actual sweetness). You can also add on special ingredients but have to pay per item such as bubbles, or jello. I like the consistency of the drink, the temperature and how cold it is.\n",
      "Line seems to always be super long which is a downside but the drinks are always good. Chewy soft boba and they tend to give a lot. The flavor is always really good - tried the earl grey latte today and loved it.\n",
      "3 stars based on quality and service-\n",
      "\n",
      "The tea itself is actually very good; I could actually taste the tea which is great. However, the boba isn't the best and reminds me of TeaDo pearls. It's not sweetened beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is also just okay. My friend had to repeat her order 4+ times since the cashier had trouble finding it on her order system. I asked for white pearls in my drink and just got regular pearls instead. The wait was already long and knowing that they'd just charge me more (white pearls cost more), I didn't bother asking them to remake my order.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to give them a second chance but hopefully they improve the next time I return!\n",
      "Milk foam green tea is the most popular one. I like to order it with 50% sugar and white pearl or coconut jelly, because you don't need chew them that much. Soy milk green tea latte is also a surprise for someone who is lactose intolerant.\n",
      "Great big selection and very customizable. The milk tea is very tea-y; not the usual super sweet/super milky drink that bigger boba places serve. I tried the regular black tea based milk tea w boba (bobas were just a tad smaller and a little chewier) with 50% sugar and less milk and it was pretty good! Solid tea taste, something that Kung Fu Tea severely lacks. I also tried their pudding topping, which is sweet and tastes like butterscotch! Drinks come out pretty fast now that the opening craze has gone down.\n",
      "After hearing a lot of buzz about Gong Cha, I was able to try it yesterday! It's located across the street from ChaTime and Beard Papa. I arrived around 6:15 PM and it was pretty bustling. Gong Cha is a small, cozy space with just one bench that seats a few people. There isn't much room to stand! \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered one of their specialties​, the Milk Foam Green Tea ($3.75 for a medium- their starting size). The service was quick and efficient. The cashier will ask you what kind of toppings you'd like and your preferred sugar level for the drink. I requested no toppings and a sugar level of 70%. I got my drink in about four minutes or so! There was a line steadily forming by the time I was done placing my order. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't have my drink until I got home, so all the layers were mixed together! Luckily, the foam was still distinguishable when I sipped. It was lightly salted, which was something so new to me! The tea itself was sweet, so the salty/sweet combination really worked for me. The green tea flavor was subtle but definitely prominent. The foam layer made everything taste so creamy and decadent! I let my mom try some and she was surprised​ by how good it was (she's not really a big fan of sweets). The 70% sugar level was just right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gong Cha's menu is quite expansive. I'm excited to give some other drinks a try! :- )\n",
      "I have mixed feelings about this Gong Cha. Having been to multiple other locations, primarily in California, I think that the quality of the drinks here is below average compared to the rest of the franchise. That being said, the drinks are still consistent and solid, and definitely the best boba that I've had in Boston. My go-to drink (especially since it's currently the dead of winter and average temperatures are in the single digits Fahrenheit if not below zero) is a hot Earl Grey Milk Tea with Boba and 30% sugar. I think it tastes better than the regular Pearl Milk Tea, and it's the same price. I would like for the drink to be a bit hotter (it's definitely more than warm, but not really hot-hot), but I've at least never gotten a lukewarm beverage. When it's not freezing cold, the Earl Grey Milk Tea with 3 J's (jelly, pudding, and boba) is a bomb choice. Unfortunately, that drink only comes in cold since the jelly and pudding would disintegrate if hot. \n",
      "\n",
      "The shop itself is *tiny*, and the line can sometimes be out the door (although granted, out-the-door is about 7 people). Service is hit or miss (depending on the workers), but usually solid and not slow. The boba itself is pretty good, nicely chewy but not too mushy or sweet. I also like the size of the boba here, not as ginormous as the honey boba you get at some other shops. And if you're looking for something more adventurous, check out the Mustache Series - the Milk Foam is tasty!\n",
      "The lines are ridiculous and it's super confusing but they always get your drink right and the quality is VERY high! I used to go to Kung fu tea but now it's very hard to, knowing this is available!\n",
      "I come here every weekend to get my milk tea fix, the aroma of the tea is unique that I've never came across anywhere before. As soon as I step inside the door, that delicious smell just hit up to my nose. \n",
      "Wide selection of tea. The boba is perfectly sweet and chewy.\n",
      "Line is long most of the time, but it goes fast and worth the wait.\n",
      "It's currently my favorite bubble milk tea.\n",
      "After coming to this Gong Cha at least 3 times since it opened, I have to say it's now one of my favorite places to get bubble tea in Boston's Chinatown. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried their regular pearl milk tea, milk foam green tea, milk foam brown sugar ginger tea, & matcha milk w/ red bean. The tea flavor is quite strong compared to most other places. I like how their default sugar level is 70%, which is just right for me and none of the drinks leave an overly-sweet aftertaste. They also have some different toppings, like white pearls (which have a slight crunchiness and remind me of aloe). \n",
      "\n",
      "Line has died down since the opening, and while there always seems to be a steady stream of customers, orders are filled pretty quickly.\n",
      "I love Gong Cha especially green milk tea... amazing!! The regular black milk tea is also nice!\n",
      "A friend and the Internet told me this chain was so good so I decided on a cold Saturday afternoon, that waiting outside in close to freezing weather for about half an hour for a B1G1 was worth it. It's located right across from Chatime so you can just stare each other down from the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior is pretty small and there are no tables. Just a window bench that takes up the whole length so probably about room for 5 to 6 people to sit and wait for their order. Order was fulfilled quick. Sugar level is 70% by default, FYI. I chose 100% because of my sweet tooth and found it to be perfectly sweet. I love it. The pearls are a good amount of chewy and digestible. Prices are decent and the people are friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love that they have little carton things they insert into the to-go bags to make sure your drinks aren't falling over each other in the bag. I wish I got a photo but I was too busy being cold. Amazing thinking really. Will definitely come back.\n",
      "Just recently starting coming to this place and am now officially addicted. My go-to drink is the caramel milk tea 70% sweetness and my boyfriend loves the brown sugar milk tea %100 sweetness. Their boba is cooked to perfection, in my opinion and are consistent each time. My only complaint is ordering online through yelp, since they can be filled to the brim with customers, they missed my order on 2 occasions. I'm then forced to wait in their already tightly packed waiting area for an additional 30-40 mins each time, even though I try ordering ahead.\n",
      "One of the better bubble tea chains here in Boston! I like that Gong Cha has your classic flavors as well as some unique  flavors that you can't find anywhere else. Their taro milk tea is pretty standard, but I recently tried their milk foam green tea and I found it to be really good!! \n",
      "\n",
      "I have never heard of milk foam before and I was pleasantly surprised at how well the saltiness of the foam balanced well with the sweetness of the tea. The foam was a good buttery texture, and is even better when you mix it with the tea. It's the perfect balance between sweetness and saltiness. They have a lot of varieties of teas with the milk foam topping  (they call it the mustache series) and I cannot wait to try them all out. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only con is this place is super small and there is limited seating along the window. So definitely better for bubble tea on the go. Also, be ready to wait for a bit during peak times because there can be line literally out the door!!\n",
      "Finally got to try the Dirty Brown Sugar Milk! It was exactly the type of sweet drink I needed after a savory meal. The brown sugar flavor enhanced the drink as a whole. Definitely recommend this to those who prefer a sweeter type of drink! \n",
      "\n",
      "Gong Cha has been my go to places ever since Korea. It tasted just like how it does in Korea. The store is really small so the line went out the door around the corner. Considering the number of people there the service was efficient and we got our drinks relatively fast.\n",
      "I am obsessed with their milk foam tea. This is the only place offering it in Boston. Boba is so ordinary and why be ordinary when you can be extra? My personal favorite is jasmine green tea milk foam with like ice and 50% sugar. The milk foam comes in a cup with a lid in lieu of a straw (for the turtles!) and you get a perfect amount of foam topping with every sip of tea it's wonderful.\n",
      "I heard about this place and I was kind of disappointed. I wasn't sure why there's such a huge hype for this. It's your typical chain boba place. Comparing it to chatime, kungfu, and gong cha, there's not much of a stand out. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got their Jasmine tea with salted foam - pudding and boba added. The Jasmine tea was refreshing, I got 50% sugar, but it seem like they gave me 25%. It was more on the bitter side. Luckily the pudding and boba added the sweetness for it to be bearable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I wouldn't wait in a long line for this when across the street there's chatime, and just a block away there's Kungfu tea.\n",
      "The tea was very flavorful. The combinations of textures and tastes were very good. my tongue. There was a large selection to pick from. The tapioca was very fresh. Much better than what I usually have. I loved that I could pick how much sugar and ice I wanted. Ice waters down the flavor, so I picked no ice.  Prices were lower than most.\n",
      "If you don't take Ali Pay anymore, take the sticker off please. Don't need to trick the costumer with bad attitude.\n",
      "When first came here would of been a five but the line makes it a one now. Ubereats, GrubHub, Postmates, and Doordash make this place a one . Strawberry Milk Tea is great but the line now is less than a 1. You only can come here when the line isn't close to the door because if it is you will have to wait for 30 orders of Tea that skip you in line from an app ordering service. If they had two registers it won't be as bad but now it is just a garbage location with one register. The five star is for the drink and -4 for the wait. Seen it multiple times waiting for my drink where delivery boys come in order 30 drinks then have five people immediately exit the line.\n",
      "Long line in 39 degree weather.  Small take-out tea shop with only one bench.  Fast service. Got the Matcha Milk Foam Tea with 70% sugar (still too sweet) and less ice.  Pretty good.  I like the creamy milk foam floating in the drink.\n",
      "Love the place! I don't normally write reviews but this was worth it! I accidentally ordered the wrong item But the ladies there where super nice to make me another drink! Thank You ! Really recommend it if you're craving some bubble tea!\n",
      "My 14-year old wanted bubble tea, and this place had the best rating and was not questionable health wise from the exterior appearance... lots of teenagers to 20 something's pouring in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Menu is pretty big.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seemed to wait quite a while. Comes in a sealed top cup, you poke a straw through. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the black foam coffee, large, no sugar or ice. It was just okay - the liquid part. The foam was really good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wife got a passion fruit slushy and said it was good. Daughter got a strawberry milk tea and said it was really good, an enthusiastic five stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I am too old to appreciate these cold tea and coffee drinks. I'd give mine a three, so we will split the difference, four overall.\n",
      "It was very busy when I came. It's a small restaurant - definitely grab and go because there are no tables and only on bench area inside. Because it was very busy it was like standing in a packed MBTA train because everyone is waiting for their order or in line. The line flows outside since not everyone can fit inside. The variety of drinks and customization options are great. Would recommend coming here for your boba fix.\n",
      "This place is very small and there's always a line. There's really no seating except for a small bench. So you can't really sit and chill with your friends there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their menu is placed all the way in the back of the store so you can't even read the menu until you're near the front of the line. They should say put a menu outside or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a very extensive tea menu. I've tried their milk teas and fruit teas and never had one that I didn't like. You can customize your tea with the sugar and ice level. However their boba topping isn't that great. It's on the softer side and isn't sweet at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this place if you're craving boba. Just be prepared for a line and know your order before you get to the front.\n",
      "Wow. Recently tried gong cha in Burlington mall and it was excellent. Craved one in Chinatown today and it was the complete opposite experience. There were only three people in front of me. I ordered and they called two numbers after mine. I went to check on my order in case they missed it and they said it was almost complete. They called two more numbers and then finally mine, just to find that they messed up my order. I ordered a milk foam green tea and was given my drink without the milk foam... yes, just a cup of tea. They took the drink back to fix but I didn't receive it until they had fulfilled two more orders. Even when I received my drink, the milk foam was not more than a centimeter thick. Completely disappointing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I won't be returning to this gong cha location. I love the drinks at the company so it's a shame but this was one of the most frustrating experiences and I would not recommend that anyone visit the store in Chinatown. Awful service, no apologies, and wasted time.\n",
      "One of my favorite boba spots of all time. This location is my favorite compared to their other locations in MA. The tea here just tastes the best compared to their other locations. The boba is sometimes a hit or miss bc sometimes the boba is too soggy and just tastes like mush. \n",
      "Some of my favorite and must try drinks would be: Pearl milk tea, egg pudding milk tea, brown sugar milk foam oolong tea, passion fruit tea and winter melon tea\n",
      "Gong cha, my new favorite boba place in Boston! I first discovered Gong Cha when I visited Hong Kong years ago. I literally had Gong Cha every other day! Ever since, I have been constantly on a search to find a boba shop comparable to Gong Cha until a few franchises started opening in New York and California! I was forever satisfied but New York and California is still far from Boston which means I can only get this occasionally! \n",
      "\n",
      "They are having their grand opening week this week and are doing a buy one get one free special on 5 featured drinks! They also have an extended menu of different drinks. There is definitely something for everyone. The milk foam green tea is my fav! The tea is fragrant and with 50% sugar level, it is perfect! One thing I like about them is they are super quick with the drink orders. At other boba shops nearby, I have to wait for days for my drink. Sometimes it makes me wonder if they are still picking the tea leaves for my drink up in the mountains. The boba is perfectly sweetened and chewy! The boba is a little smaller than other places, which I prefer. I am so excited that Gong Cha is finally in Boston!\n",
      "I stumbled across this little place through my walk down the streets of Boston! Although the lines are long, the service is fast, and the prices are reasonable. The drinks are phenomenal, and if you can't find the flavor you want on the menu, you can create and personalize your own! Best bubble tea in town, definitely going back in the near future. This place truly gives you the delicate and exquisite taste of the famous bubble teas in the streets of Chinatown.\n",
      "My first experience with Gongcha was in South Korea so I was glad to see one pop up in our little Chinatown here in Boston! I'm a creature of habit so I usually get the Taro milk tea with extra tapioca, normal sweetness, which I did on this visit. The line was out the door but moved fairly quickly. The staff was friendly and mostly organized for the rush. They have an extensive menu so I believe there is something for everyone's taste. The fact that you can customize your drink (amount of ice, level of sweetness) is something I really love. My drink was perfect and a lovely treat to have to remember my travels in South Korea.\n",
      "ALWAYS crowded. But if you're in Chinatown, might as well get the good stuff. My favorite is all the oolong tea mixes. But when I came with my sister, the lychee green tea was good too! The Gong Cha is Alston is just as good without the wait and that storefront is much nicer.\n",
      "I don't think any boba place in Boston has non-dairy milk options for milk tea. Gong Cha is no different. It is also very small and cramped. The boba I had was not chewy enough.\n",
      "Pearl Milk Tea did not taste fresh.\n",
      "Great tea but the price is really high. I got the strawberry milk tea which is really good\n",
      "Disappointing given Gong Cha's pretty good reputation elsewhere. Not sure what it is about their Boston locations, but the boba is consistently poorly cooked- small, hard, and overall a waste of money spent. Black milk tea was fine, but the poor quality of the boba ruins the drink. As a result I tend to avoid the Gong Cha locations in Boston if I have an alternative\n",
      "While in the area, I decided to stop by Gong Cha for a late night boba run.\n",
      "\n",
      "DRINKS:\n",
      "I got a large Matcha Milk Tea with boba, and a large Matcha Slush (Can you tell that I love matcha?!) Both drinks were okay, I've had worse matcha drinks but tonight it was not as strong as my previous visits. Maybe its because I came about 35-40 minutes before closing. I wouldn't recommend getting the slush again, it was mainly ice and a small hint of matcha. The boba itself was nice and soft. \n",
      "\n",
      "SERVICE:\n",
      "Pretty standard for a small boba shop. Although there was a line, the drinks were made pretty fast. I couldn't tell if the drinks were half-assed though. From what I see over the counter, they had about 5-6 workers working in that cramped little space. I'd rather have quality drinks over quantity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd give Gong Cha another try. I do love their drinks, maybe I'll pass up on their Matcha/Slush options though.\n",
      "Gong Cha is a Taiwanese bubble chain franchise, that has stores all over the world. I've had Gong Cha in Asia before and was happy to see that there is now finally a branch in Boston. \n",
      "The store is tiny, and the line was super long. It was really hard to see the menu until you got into the store, so I pulled up the menu on my phone. I decided to have milk tea with bubbles, and it was quite good. You can also choose your sugar level. There isn't any room to sit so I would recommend taking your drink and going elsewhere.\n",
      "My one gripe about bubble tea in the US is the price... 2 bubble teas cost almost $10. Its way cheaper in Asia so I will only come here for the occasional treat.\n",
      "I drink boba a few times a year and original milk tea with boba is always my go to drink! If offered, I always get 30% sugar because I like my milk tea to be bitter tasting. Luckily gong cha does offer varied sugar levels so this is exactly what I got. I'm not sure if it was because of the lowered sugar level, but the milk tea I got had barely any milk tea flavor in it. It tasted like I was drinking straight up milk/cream with a hint of tea. The boba itself is fine but I was extremely disappointed with the lack of flavor of the milk tea. Not sure if it was a bad batch or just this location but I ended up throwing it away since it wasn't worth drinking. With so many boba shops around, I probably won't be going back.\n",
      "I'm not much of a bubble tea aficionado. However I know when I find a good bubble tea place because the tea is always just how I like it. I like it not to better but not too sweet, because I want to be able to taste the flavor of the tea without just tasting straight sugar. I had heard from my Asian friends that Gong Cha was a good bubble tea place and it's also a chain. I'm from the south east coast so there's not many Gong Chas near me so I decided to try out this place while in Boston. I am so happy I went because it has been honestly one of the top five bubble tea places I've been to. I got the mango bubble tea with lychee jelly added. I had asked for no extra sugar and light ice because I always feel like that dilutes the flavor of the tea. I was so pleasantly surprised at how authentic the flavor was, and now I am just so sad because there's not another Gong Cha near me unfortunately. I also loved all the people working at the store because they really helped me narrow down which tea I wanted because they have a huge selection of options. I think you could get a new bubble tea every day for two months and never repeat one twice.\n",
      "I've been here twice now, and both times, the brown sugar and ginger milk tea was AMAZING.. I ordered it cold, and with pearls,  and I'm pretty sure the large ran about $6. These drinks are worth every dollar!!! I'm not alone in feeling this way, because on each of my visits, the lines were out the door. As for the flavor, I really enjoyed the combination of sweet and spicy, a perfect balance, and that there are actual pieces of ginger, along with lots of boba. Speaking of the boba (called pearls at this shop), their texture is nice and chewy, and their taste is slightly sweet.  Don't take my word! Try a cup, and see for yourself. Next time we go back, I'm definitely trying something new, especially since the menu is so extensive, and I already have my eye on a couple of other milk types, including the mustache series, caramel milk, Thai, earl grey with three jellies, and the winter melon. All of them sound great!!! Oh, and also, the workers seem pleasant, and try hard to make your drink exactly how you want it; with lots of ice or not, with 70% sugar or less, etc.. ENJOY!\n",
      "I love boba here . And you can skip the line which is really nice . But the only problem I have to remember ordering gongcha is alway less sugar . There drink a little on the sweeter end but ordering less sugar seem to be the trick . There boba not the best but jts decent .\n",
      "This was the first time I tried gong cha. Tiny little place in China town but filled with people. Mildk foam was recommended by my friend so I got the oolong tea with milk foam with bubbles. Initially I enjoyed it but then the milk foam tasted sour. Not sure why. I would probably try it again but I feel it is a bit overpriced for what you get. (Although somewhat trendy)...\n",
      "This is probably my favorite milk tea in Boston. Never go wrong with their foam milk tea. It may taste salty, but that's perfect with the sweetness of milk tea. 70% sugar or less will be the good choice. Love it!\n",
      "Service is nice and accommodating but product isn't something I'd go out of my way for! Ordered a classic milk tea with cold foam on top with no sugar. Mistake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cold foam is fun but I'd definitely recommend less sugar vs none. Typically when I order no sugar, my tea and the herbal jelly or Boba will sweeten it up or add a pleasing element to my drink. And when you drink tea in general you don't always need sugar for delightful flavor however I thought the drink tasted very strange, plain and semi thick. Went back and asked for a shot of cane syrup and it changed the dynamic of the beverage completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the greatest first impression and wouldn't go out of my way to come here. However, would return if I were in the area and if I felt open enough to want to try a different drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "Place is super small with a bench along the window for seating. Not the kind of place you'd come to catch up.\n",
      "Was excited to try a new tea location but honestly Gong Cha was incredibly underwhelming. Got a Pearl Milk Tea with less ice and half sugar. Tea itself was quite bitter - and you may say it's because of how I ordered but at other tea shops and even in Taiwan, my milk tea would not be that bitter. I will give props to the good texture and plentiful boba though but that's about the only good thing of my entire drink.\n",
      "This place is nice! It's your classic bubble tea shop with lots of options and fast service. There isn't really room to sit down so it's good for grab and go. I got a locker oolong with bubbles and it was made perfectly so I would definitely stop by again.\n",
      "Milk Tea is very delicious. I came here the often times. Today I ordered a large size 50%sugar so testy I love it. I will come back again.\n",
      "Perhaps I went on a very bad day. The store is absolutely tiny and there is no enforcement of social distancing, nor do they use the system that the corporate branch set up for contactless pickup. \n",
      "The first thing you see when you open the door is a QR code asking you to order online for contactless pickup, so I did. I had to reenter several times into the extremely crowded store to see whether my order was ready and after I waited 20 minutes past the pickup time, the cashier told me to repurchase it in person since they did not check the online platform. She claimed she would cancel the order so it wouldn't charge twice. I left with my order, which tasted par for the course. \n",
      "My card was charged twice and when I called back to request a refund, they hung up on me.\n",
      "The milk tea here is one of the best that Boston has to offer at the moment. I love their Oolong milk tea and the Lemon Ai-Yu drinks. The sugar level is normally too sweet for my taste, so I usually order 30-50% sweetness depending on the toppings I get. If it's a drink with syrup, I recommend getting 0% sugar since the syrup is already sweet enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is pretty quick. They always look like they're rushing to get all the orders done to beat some record. You order the drink(s), pay, and get your drink. Before covid, I've always gotten my drinks within 5 min unless there's a long line. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have to agree with others regarding Covid guidelines not being followed or enforced at this location. This is why I always recommend ordering ahead online (I use Uber Eats). This way you can get notified when your order is ready for pick up and you avoid staying in the shop longer than needed.\n",
      "With the influx of bubble tea shops opening all over, it was a matter of time before Boston saw another big name spot open up. I attempted to go on grand opening weekend but drove by and saw a line of at least 50 long at any given time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually I waited for the initial hype to die down so I didn't have to wait more than maybe 10-15 minutes in line. There is a good amount of selections but to make it easy I ordered off of the top 10 drinks menu. My favorite drink so far would have to be the milk foam green tea. Most other bubble tea shops, the flavor of the tea get drowned away by the overpowering of sugar/sweetener. At Gong Cha, you noticed right away the taste of tea in the drink. I also tried the Taro milk tea but was disappointed by the fact of tasting small chunks of powder in my drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is good but the inside is very small and everybody is packed in there like sardines. With another option for bubble tea in chinatown, ill most likely only go to Gong Cha if the line is on the shorter end and I prefer not to wait out in the cold during the winter months.\n",
      "Cashier is rude!! Talking in chinese about customer is \"damn stupid\". I don't know which customer they are teasing about. But it is so rude and mean! I think at least every customer deserve your respect. Please hire someone qualified.\n",
      "This store is too crowded and they have been making a lot of mistakes with orders. Was overcharged yesterday and the drink they gave me was not what I ordered. Disappointing overall. There are better shops in Chinatown for boba anyhoo, skip this place. The Allston Gongcha is leagues better.\n",
      "Got 50% sugar Taro Milk Tea with pudding.  No ice was fine because of the freezing Boston weather.  Going to try 30% sugar next time.  The drink was not made well.  There were chunks of powder in the drink.  The pudding was ok.  Their milk foam caps are better than Kung Fu Tea and Tbaar.\n",
      "Yum! Had the standard Milk Tea with 50% sweetness and pearls. It was excellent. The line was out the door. So many options to choose from, it was hard to decide. Wish we had one where I lived so I could try more flavors.\n",
      "I'm a huge boba snob, and I think Gong Cha is just okay. BUT I also grew up in LA, and east coast boba has nothing on west coast boba. However, there isn't really a better boba place in Boston. So for Boston standards, this is probably the place to go. The only better place to get boba in Boston (technically outside of Boston), isn't even a boba shop -- it's at Tasty Pot in Allston.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I really appreciate about Gong Cha is that they have a soy milk option for your drinks, unlike all the other boba spots in the area, so perfect for y'all who are dairy-free or vegan or anything! They are also the only place that has white boba, if you're a fan of that. (I personally am not.)\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite things that I've tried here are their matcha (soy)milk tea with red bean and their taro (soy)milk tea with boba. I always get my drinks half sweet!\n",
      "I was in Boston last year in November and tried a few bubble tea shops throughout the city. Gong Cha in China Town was by far the best one! The line looked intimidating (started from outside the store), but the wait was surprisingly short. The store itself is quite small, it's not a place that you can sit and sip your tea after you order. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a variety of drinks and toppings to choose from in the menu. I had the Taro Milk Tea and it was delicious! \n",
      "\n",
      "Recommend trying as many shops as you can while in Boston (especially if you're from somewhere that has few, if any, bubble tea shops), but definitely Gong Cha if you can only go to one.\n",
      "Easily ordered through Yelp. Went and picked it up no-contact and my drink was delicious. I will be back!\n",
      "People who work here literally are slow. Don't know what they are doing and line moves slow. Kid at register is drinking his own milk tea while taking a order and uses one hand to give money back to customer. There was 6 customers in front of me and I waited 10 minutes to move 2 spots. Not worth. Terrible customer service. Really not worth\n",
      "A fair wait time and decent milk tea. \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I both got the hot milk tea the first time around and we came back a second time to try it cold. Both times it wasn't too bad but we agreed that it had a stronger toffee taste than your typical milk tea. It may have also been just me but I also felt like mine had a slight bitter aftertaste. I'll be coming back to give this place another try since there's still a lot on the menu I haven't tried. Hopefully I'll find something that's a little better!\n",
      "After trying many many boba places around Boston, this is definitely my favorite out of all them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although I think there are a couple things on the menu that aren't the best, I'd say that 75% of the things are a hit and 25% aren't.\n",
      "\n",
      "My newly discovered favorite is the milk foam brown sugar oolong tea 50 or 75% sweet. \n",
      "\n",
      "It isn't sweet like some of the other milk teas and doesn't feel heavy to drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "The milk foam is a bit salty and compliments the slight bitter taste of the oolong.\n",
      "It was so packed and it seemed like the staff were just okay. In the winter time, you'll just see Moose Knuckles, Canada Goose and Moncler. The wait isn't thaaaattt bad, but I think the drinks are just okay. Chinatown bubble tea shops seem to add a lot more sugar than other places, so I always go a little bit less than what I usually do.\n",
      "The staff here are SLOOOOOOOOW. They have about 4 people working here a day and apparently it takes all 4 of them to make drinks instead of having someone STAY AT THE REGISTER to keep the line moving. The line is always out the door, not because it's the greatest milk tea in Chinatown, but simply because the operation is piss poor. The place is way too busy for the cashier to multitask serving duties, and a less cluttered more bolder menu is needed so that people won't have to wait until they get all the way up to the register to be able to read the menu and decide what they want which adds more time to the already slow service. Kung-Fu Tea, Royal Tea, and Chatime have less staff and can get orders completed way faster, so Gong Cha needs to get it together!\n",
      "Don't get me wrong - the drinks here are great. I had the mango green tea with boba, and it was such a treat in the summer heat. You can choose your sweetness and ice levels, too. When it's cooler, I want to try the milk foam options.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when my boyfriend and I went, there was no A/C. I get that sometimes there's no A/C in Boston (I am originally from Texas), but the poor employees were stuck in the small store with some fans and a long, endless line of customers to serve. It was hotter inside the store (think hot enough to make your shins sweat) than outside. I felt really bad for them, and I hope they get some relief soon.\n",
      "There's always a line here, so you just gotta bite the bullet and wait in line (this is what I tell myself). \n",
      "\n",
      "Things I've tried:\n",
      "QQ Passion Fruit Green Tea - light and refreshing, goes well with coconut jelly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearl Milk Tea - it tasted off, like too much cream or something. They also gave me a large instead of a medium, which would usually be a good thing except the proportions of milk/cream to tea was not right. They were busy so I guess the mess up was understandable? Then again, a bubble tea place should not mess up the classic bubble milk tea? Yeah, I'm torn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Milk Foam Green Tea with White Pearl - I liked that I could taste the tea. The milk foam was interesting - creamy and a little salty. Not really my thing, but worth a try. The white pearls were \"crunchy\" (kinda like coconut jelly, but in ball form?), I would get it again/recommend it. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I wasn't impressed and honestly have experienced more consistent drinks from KFT. I would give Gong Cha another try and their dirty brown sugar milk tea seems popular.\n",
      "Gong Cha is a super tiny place tucked into a corner with super long lines on weekends!! So it's hard to miss this place. But don't worry the line moves very fast as there is no seating area inside and everybody gets enough time while waiting in queue to know their fixing. My 2 favorites here are the Lychee slush with basil seeds, coconut jelly  and the Taro milk tea with black pearls. I like the fact that they let you pick your sugar level (Max 70%) and the ice level. The quality and consistency of this place is what brings me back here.\n",
      "Let me start by saying I've given this place SO many tries but it never fails to disappoint me and waste my money. I love Gong Cha, but I would rather drink the other boba shops around Chinatown at this rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, I ordered 3 drinks. I clearly said exactly what I wanted from all the drinks. Even used hand motions in case my words were lost. They were all messed up. Literally was given lukewarm bubble tea (did they even shake with ice??). Asked for ice but didn't even give me ice, alright fine. Asked for boba and didn't even give me boba....that's just crazy. So they added boba after and resealed it. When I finally got to drink it, it literally had ZERO sweetness. This has never happened before. I was literally in shock. Water would've been better. Like how did it have no sweetness if it had no ice to dilute it. That was a huge waste of almost $6 for ONE drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of dilution, literally 75% of the times I've ordered from here, they don't mix the ice with the drink to get it to the same temperature, so the ice ends up melting quickly, making the drink taste watery, diluted, less sweet, and lukewarm. The first thing I learned when I worked at a drink shop was to properly shake the drink and ice to make it cool and in the same temperature. It's common sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think this was the last straw for me. This may seem extra but IF YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW.\n",
      "I think gong cha is the best boba place in Boston. Kung fu tea is honestly not even comparable. My personal favorite is their coffee milk tea. You can actually taste the coffee, milk tea is just sweet enough, and the bubbles are firm and fresh. I really don't think I can get boba from anywhere else other than gong cha.\n",
      "Came here with my little cousin, Amy N. on a friday night at 1045pm. \n",
      "The line was ridiculous, to the door.\n",
      "This a small establishment, no public restrooms, tables or chairs.\n",
      "There is a small bench like area for 4 people max.\n",
      "Because it was 30* with high wind chills, everyone got their drinks and stayed inside the shop. We were all packed like sardines and getting cozy. LOL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drinks are good: I got a oolong milk tea with white pearls and my cousin got a milk tea with regular boba.\n",
      "We were satisfied with our drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the 30 patrons that came between 11-12am, we stayed on the bench area until they closed and they never told us to leave.\n",
      "Very nice staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "**They do not have a minimum for cards.\n",
      "Gong Cha had lines out the door on Saturday afternoon, and I thought I was missing out on something great - that was not the case.  I ordered the Earl Grey milk tea, and couldn't taste anything except powered milk.  No earl grey, no tea, just milk, and not the refreshing kind.  It's a total pass for me!  The menu is large so maybe I ordered the wrong thing, and the crowd was non-stop in the afternoon.\n",
      "Drink: 4\n",
      "Ambience: 2\n",
      "Service: 4\n",
      "Overall: 3.5\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is pretty good compared to their surrounding competitors. I wish there was more seating, but it's understandable since the space is limited. But it does defer me to visit other establishments with seating in the winter. This is the first place in Chinatown,  from my knowledge, that has cheese foam! I recommend trying cheese foam at least once. Sounds gross, but tastes soooo good. The hype right now is black sugar boba, I personally don't see/taste much of a difference. Sugar is sugar.\n",
      "I'm here almost every weekend because I'm obsessed with their milk foam drinks. I've tried other drinks here as well and all have been tasty but I always go back to my order of milk foam brown sugar oolong tea. Line is always long and place is crowded but worth it because it's the best bubble tea in Chinatown.\n",
      "Gong cha consistently tastes great for me. I usually get the earl grey with 3 J's (herbal jelly, pudding, pearls)  and the Thai tea with boba.  Gong cha definitely have some of the best boba drinks in Boston.  The store is set up as a grab and go where people would get their boba and leave the store afterwards. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why only the 4 stars you may ask?  When the store is very busy, the service is poor. There were times when people would get their orders fulfilled  before me even though I ordered first and bought the same type of drinks.  This should not be happening. As a result, I would only recommend getting drinks from this boba place if it is not crowded. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: come early for the best service and drinks!\n",
      "The milk tea here tastes great. There are a lot of toppings to choose and many kinds of them are tasty. The price is not low among so many milk tea shops but I think they deserve it.\n",
      "Hands down my favorite place to get thai tea. The tea and cream ratio is always right so you get a hint of the tea & not just the cream. The line is usually out the door, but it does move quite fast. There is no seating area so be prepared to take it to go.\n",
      "Gong Cha is just the best thing that happened to Boston in 2018. This location is packed most of the time, so much that it is worth getting it delivered. Except if you're getting milk cap. But this store has consistently been reasonably clean, friendly, and have never gotten a bad drink from them. Awesome place\n",
      "The \"Gong\" in Gong Cha is a funny word. Apparently the way we say it in English is not how it sounds like in Cantonese - the pronunciation and tone is way off!\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Gong Cha seems like a traditional sort of bubble tea shop, I was excited to try their bubble tea! I've ordered the Oolong Tea and Lemon Ai-Yu with White Pearls. No disappointment. In the lemon ai-yu with white pearls, there's a light brown pudding-like jelly in the drink. It tastes like a light version of grass jelly. I'm assuming it's \"Ai-Yu\", but I have yet to figure out what that is.. Besides that, the white pearls are pretty cool! It's easier to chew on in comparison to black pearls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a heads up, Gong Cha is not meant to be a place to lounge around after getting your drink. When you walk in, you basically line up along the counter until you get to the cash register to order. To order, you choose your drink, size, toppings, sugar level, and ice level. Then you stand back a few steps or sit along the window to wait for your drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend Gong Cha to those who enjoy the tea more than the artificial fruity tastes in bubble tea. I'll definitely be coming back to try more tea and to ask what Ai-Yu is!\n",
      "This is probably my favorite place to get boba in all of Massachusetts aside from the other location in Burlington, MA and the Kung Fu Tea near Newbury Street. The drinks are made promptly, the boba is soft and sweet, and there are a plethora of options on the menu. An indicator of Gong Cha's quality is how long the line is at the store--often, it goes out the door and onto the sidewalk. \n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite orders:\n",
      "- Brown Sugar Oolong Milk Foam with 50% sugar and boba -- this drink can get a little sweet, but the milk foam balances the brown sugar flavor out and adds a lot of depth. There's a perfect mix of sweet and a little salty. Brown Sugar Oolong Tea isn't available at KFT so I'd highly recommend it at Gong Cha. The Dirty Brown Sugar series is also quite good, albeit expensive.\n",
      "- Oolong Milk Tea with 50% sugar and herbal jelly -- this drink is my go-to, especially when scouting out a new boba place. You really can't go wrong with this one, unless the shop doesn't offer herbal jelly. In that case, I just go for... \n",
      "- Green Milk Tea with 50% sugar and boba -- a classic.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tip would be to get a drink with 0% ice, but that honestly depends on whether you want your drink to stay cold for a very long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "One downside of this location is that there is no room to enjoy your drink -- there is only one window-side bench to sit, and most people wait there for their orders. This store is very small and in that aspect, I would say Kung Fu Tea wins out.\n",
      "I remember trying Gong Cha in NYC before but don't remember liking it very much. I decided to give it a try here and was very surprised at how good the milk tea was. When you walk in, you get a very strong and refreshing tea aroma. The wait was around 10 mins, but they made the drinks fairly fast. I ordered the regular Pearl Milk Tea (my go to at any bubble tea place) and got my girlfriend the hot mill tea with red bean.\n",
      "\n",
      "The milk tea is very aromatic, a little too aromatic for my girlfriend. I thought it was perfectly milky and aromatic. The boba had the perfect consistency and sweetness. The red bean was not too mushy and still retained it's flavor & sweetness. Gong Cha definitely has the best milk tea in Chinatown. Will be back when I crave something milky.\n",
      "Not the cheapest for bubble tea in Chinatown, but quite good and they do seem to have more staff and thus faster service than Cha Time across the street.  The key here is to ask for 30% sugar; any higher and it's too sweet, any less and it's too bland.  Best value strategy, especially during Covid19 lockdown conditions, is to order size large with no ice for takeout, then go home and add your own ice.\n",
      "What else can I really say.... this place rocks... it rocks so hard I'll walk 10 blocks late night to get one. In the rain. Up hill both ways. \n",
      "I mean come on people who doesn't love bubble tea? It's classic! The flavors and add ons are awesome and they also are available for order from Uber Eats! Treat choself!\n",
      "I'm glad to see one after I moved to Boston. I typically get milk green tea, earl grey, thai tea, or a brewed tea without milk and i like to compare other tea shops and see how they compare. I can definitely say gong cha is my favorite tea place\n",
      "The Chinatown location is very small with no seats so there always seems to have a line. Gong cha is a must try and have some awesome flavors\n",
      "I placed an order through Chowbus and noticed that I had a free milk tea so I added it to my order. I wanted to specify that I want no nice but there was no option in Chowbus app to enter notes for the free milk tea so I called the store. The girl who answered the phone was incredibly rude. I told her I ordered through chowbus and that I needed to put in a request for no ice, she said once the order is made they will make it how it shows on the order. I tried to explain that I couldn't enter notes which's why I called so I can tell them my request. I told her my order but she got impatient and proceeded to tell me I didn't need to tell her that and hung up. \n",
      "There was absolutely no need for this terrible service especially when there are so many other bubble tea options nearby. I won't be returning to gongcha.\n",
      "This place has all of the regular milk tea options. The only downside is that there is little room, especially since the place has long lines. They do serve fast with 5 people working at once when I was there on Saturday night, bringing out around 4 drinks per minute.\n",
      "Boyfriend got the strawberry matcha latte with boba. He felt it was too sugary but I liked how sweet it was when I tried it. Unfortunately, they don't let you adjust the sweetness for that specific drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the lemon aiyu with white pearl and it was super refreshing. I personally didn't like the candied lemon peels in it. Next time, I'll see if they can make it without it. Other than that, it's the perfect drink for a hot summer day.\n",
      "I was visiting boston for the weekend and craving a sweet milky after a long day of sightseeing. I'm giving Gong Cha a solid 5/5 stars for delivering exactly what is promised. The service is quick and the line moves really fast. The bubble teas are delicious and you are able to customize (less sugar, less ice, milk substitution) if you want. It's a solid, no frills place and I would highly recommend for bubble tea.\n",
      "If I can give zero stars. I would. Worst customer service ever. I go here often but I will not be returning: I will contact corporate. I will let all my friends know about this horrible discriminating service. The worker saw me enter first. Suddenly a lady comes in, wave to her and spoke Chinese. Literally cut in front of me. They were giggling and whatnot. When it was my turn. She gave me a bad attitude. Thanks for my diluted drink. I asked for less ice not a ton of ice. This is very unprofessional and she needs to be retrained or fired. I was repeating my order when she put random topping and rolled her eyes at me saying she knows. Didn't even offer me a bag but gave a bag to the lady who cut me. The racism is disgusting. Please hire people that can provide actual customer service. Ruin my day. How does one give an order to a customer different from what I ask for 3 times, repeating myself. A manager needs to contact me.\n",
      "I'm a fan of Milk Tea! The staff here seem pretty nice and the restaraunt appears to be clean and organizing as well. You can smell the tapioca when you walk in the door, I love that aroma.\n",
      "Lookout Teado, you've got some competition!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, sometimes the line gets fairly long (may have to do with the finicky POS system they're using. Definitely took a long time for the transaction to go through), but this is my new FAVORITE bubble tea stop in Chinatown! \n",
      "\n",
      "First off, they've got white boba!!! Where has it been all my life?? So good. I'm very much a standard black milk tea w/boba type. And they do it very well. Prior to them, I would go to Teado (which I still enjoy their environment more). But IMO the black milk tea tastes better at Gong Cha! In addition, I think the price-point is sharper (boba-less is $3.25 vs. the same cost at Teado whether or not you have boba). It's great that you have options to change the ice level and sugar level as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward to my weekly boba trips at Gong Cha!\n",
      "Good drink! Milk foam green tea is recommend but do not shake the foam up. Right in china town downtown Boston. The store is a bit not cle\n",
      "Gong Cha in most locations have great drinks but the location in china town is small and the lines are long all day. Even half and hour before closing the lines were out the door! The music is loud and it is hard to order since they have trouble hearing you, there is also no seating inside the store. If it is your first time going to a gong cha the menu is all the way in the back of the store so when lines are long you may not be able to see once you are 3rd or 4th in line. Like most other boba places you are able to choose the sweetness level and amount of ice. I ordered the brown tea milk tea this time and it didn't have a strong tea flavor and mostly tasted like milk with sugar, but it was a good level of sweetness. Although previously I have ordered the taro milk tea which had a strong taro flavor but even at 30% sugar was too sweet. The other places in chinatown also have long lines but there are definitely places close by the make better milk tea than this Gong Cha location. Instead of going here I would recommend going to the nearby kung fu tea which is much better.\n",
      "Full disclosure -\"I'm your pay $10 dollars for drink that looks pretty\" person. And man does Gong Cha do that well. All they're drinks are really pretty, and they are actually really delicious too!! Everyone I know loves the brown sugar milk tea, and I really enjoyed the thai iced tea with a matcha foam. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love Gong Cha because they have a lot of really cool toppings and bobas. Like picking drinks of their menu is so fun!! I would highly recommend coming here. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a note - the lines get long so I would recommend ordering to pick up! Don't hesitate to just walk past the line and ask them if the drink is ready because it's a tiny shop and they don't have a designated pick up area.\n",
      "I got the mango \"yogurt\" drink and a panda Oreo with foam bubble tea. The mango yogurt drink wasn't really yogurty but it was very refreshing nonetheless. It also included little pieces of mango which was delicious. The panda Oreo foam tasted like a Oreo milkshake without the ice cream. Still delicious though! Also there's a huge line here and it will go out the door. The place is very small and cramped so you cant really stay in there for long. Also the prices are very high ranging from 4-6 dollars for a drink, depending on what you add in. But i would come here again or to another location of this place! Very delicious!\n",
      "This Gong Cha is super small!!!! But also right in the heart of Chinatown so how can I complain. The quality and consistency of this branch is the same as every Gong Cha I've been to. Don't be too concerned with long lines, they move fast. I personally think Gong Cha is the best bubble tea around these parts of Boston, the Milk tea has a strong black tea aroma and the bubbles aren't too sweet and have a nice texture. I have only had Thai Milk tea and Original Milk tea with bubbles but both are great choices. I personally reduce the sugar to 30% and little ice but any decision you make will be a good one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Done blind taste testing with myself and friends for mulitple bubble tea chains and shops. Gong Cha was consistently everyone's favorite.\n",
      "The drinks here were great.  I tried a few of them from their new Strawberry line & they were surprisingly delicious.  The line here is always out to door & the line moves super slow, so I don't think that this place would be a staple for me, but overall the boba was okay.  Staff was friendly & knowledgable of their menu too!\n",
      "Unfriendly staff. It was hard to hear what the staff was asking due to music was freaking loud. This place is not recommended and the drink was bad. Went to Kung Fu Tea to get my second one.\n",
      "I went here earlier today to see what the hype was about. It's unfortunate that the actual space of where it's located is so small, there was a line which I wasn't surprised about that was out the door. There literally was only 6 or so people inside the actual building itself, it's definitely a take out, not staying in to drink kinda place. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the roselle drink with basil seeds which is one of their personal mixes. It kinda reminds me of the hibiscus tea, sour, fruity lemonade kind of taste. The basil seeds gave it the extra pop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "Typical, chain tea place like kungfu tea and cha time. I think once it gets later past the grand opening, lines will die down and it'll just be a regular tea place like all the other chain ones.\n",
      "This was the second time I came to Gong Cha. I tried milk foam oolong tea. It was good. I think milk foam tea was one of the best choices if you don't know what to choose. The first time I came here I ordered straberry taro. The taro and strawberry were not real. They were from a can. Over-sweetened and not healthy!\n",
      "Love the tea here, very partial personally to their thai milk tea. Most bubble tea places around here don't have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To order, you choose your drink, add-ins like jelly or milk foam, how sweet you would like it (70% is their 'regular' level), and how much ice you want in the drink. You can also order them warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it gets incredibly busy here and service can sometimes go by the wayside--there was a small error with my drink, nothing huge, but when I pointed it out to the gentleman handing over the tea the cashier stopped helping another customer to correct me. I had her look at it to confirm the extra ingredient was there, but it wasn't the most pleasant experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, best tea in Chinatown, but I'd go to Tea-Do if I was looking for atmosphere.\n",
      "This place is really packed at night. There aren't many seats but the service is pretty fast. It's not ideal to hang out but it's nice for a quick grab-n-go drink. I got a taro milk tea with boba and egg pudding. You can customize sugar and ice levels, which is quite nice. They were generous with the boba and egg pudding too! The boba was cooked well with a nice chewy, \"QQ\" consistency and sweet. I'd definitely come here again for a boba fix.\n",
      "While Gong Cha wasn't exactly my cup of tea when I first tried it...I was definitely won over when I switched from their milk teas to their iced fruity teas. I ended up going back almost every day for a week straight to pick up their mango green tea since it was just that good. It has a stronger tea flavor than most but I don't mind it since I'm an avid tea drinker. Overall, I'm really happy that I gave it a second chance.\n",
      "This place reminds me a lot of the boba/juice parlors you'll find randomly scattered across malls or street corners in Asia. I used to love those places, so figured I'd stop in here with my family of 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a wide range of menu items, from smoothies to slushies, to boba teas, and with a lot of topping options. Prices are very reasonable, so there is no issue of value. I absolutely love that you can choose the level of sugar in your drink, from as a high as 100%, to 70% (considered normal sweetness), down to 30%. That was something I was not accustomed to seeing, but happy to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have given it 4 stars, but I it just seemed a bit dirty when I got here. The floor was sticky, there were dirty corners everywhere, and I just get heeby-jeeby vibes when places just don't feel really clean, especially when there is a lot of sugar in ingredients, and can invite roaches at any time (no I didn't see any roaches, but I'm just particular about cleanliness where sugar is a key ingredient).\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll probably come back here again, as the products are good.\n",
      "Quick service and good drinks!! The brown sugar milk tea and Thai tea drinks are what I would recommend to people. Whenever I order, I always ask for less ice and less sugar so the drink tastes better and not get watered down if I don't drink it fast.\n",
      "Yum! Had the standard Milk Tea with 50% sweetness and pearls. It was excellent. The line was out the door. So many options to choose from, it was hard to decide.Wish we had one where I lived so I could try more flavors.\n",
      "We were in the area and stopped by for bubble tea. Both of us enjoyed our drinks. Liked the variety and that you can select sweetness levels. Tapioca on point. There was a line, but it wasn't long. Very little seating space.\n",
      "This excellent boba tea chain is a welcome addition to the Chinatown scene, as is evidenced by the long lines out the door (that nonetheless move quickly). They have a deep but consistently tasty menu, ranging from cream top milk teas to more refreshing drinks like wintermelon and lemon aiyu. They also have a good variety of add-ins, not just boba but also white boba, lemon rind, basil seeds, etc. making it possible for everyone to find something they can enjoy, regardless of their taste preferences.\n",
      "I ordered a cup of milk tea from Gong Cha and asked them to add bubbles, but the order delivered did not have bubbles in there. I called the store to report this issue. They did not even apologize, just hang up my phone! If there is a choice of zero star, I would give them zero:(\n",
      "BOBA.\n",
      "\n",
      "YAASSSSSS, I love boba. But one thing that I love more than boba is basil seeds. And Gong cha has basil seeds! I first tried tea from Gong Cha in California then in Hong Kong. And I was excited when I saw the soon opening sign over Gong Cha in Chinatown.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came for their opening weekend, BOGO special. I waited for about 45 mins but was disappointed that the BOGO only applied to 5 drinks. Alright, I waited so long I decided to wait another 15 mins to get my drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second time here, I get the drink I want...Jasmine milk tea with basil seeds and white boba. First off, if you haven't tried white boba, try it! It's made out of agar instead of starch. And the basil seeds give a nice crunch to the drink. Also their 30% sugar is true 30% sugar, not like chatime across the street which is still really sugary.\n",
      "\n",
      "So glad that Gong Cha is finally in Boston. I just wish the craze would die down so I don't have to wait forever for my drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff are friendly. Bathroom is behind the counter.\n",
      "The staffs are not too professional or friendly...it's random... sometimes it was good... overall it's better than other tea shop in Chinatown.\n",
      "Gong Cha offers an array of teas. It was a small shop in Chinatown with a small bench along the front window for those that wanted to rest their feet after walking along the Freedom Walk. There was a line when we arrived; which moved fairly quickly.  I ordered the matcha strawberry milk tea; which was good but nowhere near as good as Boba Guys in California.\n",
      "Great place for a Chinese milk tea! Young and enthusiastic service! Will go again since we live around it!\n",
      "I ordered 3 drinks from them one large with herb jelly and coconut jelly one brown sugar milk tea with milk foam without boba and one Brown sugar milk tea with milk foam and boba but they forgot to add boba to it and charged me for it :/\n",
      "I've only went to this location three times. The store is tiny and sometimes, there's a line outside, and you can't really sit and hangout with friends without feeling suffocated. Once you're inside, the menu is at the left side of the cashier, which is a bit inconvenient if you're waiting. There's a bench near the window that can fit about 4-5 people. They do have a bathroom if you ask. One of the male cashiers was really attentive.\n",
      "We love Gong cha but the Chinatown location is really not up to par. They also consistently mess up the orders. Sadly we will not be returning\n",
      "Gong Cha replaced my favorite boba shop in Boston called Juice Bar and it does not stand up. It is just another generic, middle of the road boba place. The tea flavors are not pronounced enough and is too milky in the milk tea. The fruit shakes taste too much like they came from a sad powder mix. It's a clone of Kung Fu tea.\n",
      "One of the best tea places in town, try their milk tea with red bean at 30% sugar and/or their winter melon drink with ai-yu at 30% sugar! So, so good!\n",
      "\n",
      "I just wish the line can move a tad faster with the consumers knowing their orders before being at the register... or open 2 registers!\n",
      "I've wanted to try this place from hearing good things about it before. When it opened in Boston, i finally gave it a try! So far I have tried the pearl milk tea, earl grey milk tea, and the milk foam green tea. The pearl milk tea was sort of a disappointment considering how water'd down it was. After trying this, I was hesitant on buying from Gong Cha again. However, I came back few weeks later and gave the other drinks a try. The earl grey milk tea wasn't too bad and the milk foam green tea was good. The green tea had a strong taste and the foam had a butter like taste to it. Overall, not bad and I will be back!\n",
      "Not one to stand in line for bubble tea but Gong Cha is pretty great for someone who's not a fan of the other chains in Chinatown. Love the milk foam earl grey with boba. I've also tried the regular milk tea with boba and it's good. My usual banh mi place doesn't offer this anymore so I may have to come to Gong Cha for it, but only if there's less than 5 people in line.\n",
      "Despite awful wait times, I am upping my review to 5 stars because the bubble tea is THE REAL DEAL. Their milk tea is absolutely perfect! There are so many customization options so you can build your perfect bubble tea. I've never walked away with a bad bubble tea.\n",
      "The store is Not following the CDC guidelines for covid19 prevention.  There were no signs/guidelines outside/inside the store for mandatory masks and max personnel allowance in the store.  There were 6-8 people in the little shop while i was there.  that's about 2 ft from each person.  ideally there should be multiple signs outside and inside stating a max of two people in the shop and Enforced by the staff telling customers only 2 people only to have the proper social distancing of six feet.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i raised the concern to the staff which replied, sorry.  the only guideline the store was following is the clear acrylic Plexiglas that lined the entire counter top separating the staff from the customers.  this also made it a little hard to communicate to the staff on what you are ordering.  i had to lower my height towards the credit card machine where there is an opening to let the cashier know my order, even with that, they didn't get my order right and i had to go back after i received my drinks to have it corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the teas, it's consistent to the dozens of past visits, no complaints there.\n",
      "The bubble tea itself is absolutely awesome, but the line is absolutely bonkers. I think I've waited 15-20 min every time I went, and some of these were during what I thought were non-peak hours (2 - 5 pm, near midnight). I would get bubble tea every time from Gong Cha if it weren't for this, the milk tea is really perfect and the boba is always of great texture.\n",
      "The food and bubble tea were tasty !! I went there around 4pm at Friday, I was order Bubble tea and b1g1 free bubble tea, also BBQ beef rice meal and giant fried crispy chicken for to go, but it didn't  take me so long for waiting although there were couple orders are going in through. Overall, the experience was great with nice environment, food and service!\n",
      "Having lived in Singapore for several years where there is a gongcha on every corner, I can attest to the fact that this place is legit. Granted, I only order the pearl milk tea, but it's the most basic drink and this place is spot on. The times I've gone in, they've made my drink fairly quickly and without too much delay. As far as friendliness of the staff goes, it depends on who you get. The female staff seem to be less friendly but that's just been my experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food part of the business is whole other story. Super delayed, super oily, would never order again, but the fact that you have to complete another transaction makes me think it's a different business/owner...so it calls for a different review unless I find out otherwise in which case I'd give them 3 stars for overall experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll definitely be back for the bubble tea!!\n",
      "I went to gongcha at 7/4 they are buy one get one free (if you share the link from deal moon you will get the buy one second one free ) .I got regular bubble tea not too sweet and delicious because i'm personally don't like the sweet things you can choose how sweet the drinks also the service is nice even they was busy but still smile to the customer.good job!\n",
      "All time favorite \n",
      "Milk Foam Greentea with white boba and coconut jellies. \n",
      "Ordered it many times but I never get bored of it. One of the best milk tea I've ever had\n",
      "I want to love this place because the bubble tea is good and I can tell they brew their boba consistently throughout the day... however! The wait times here are ridiculous. I watched two people make 12 different elaborate large bubble tea drinks for delivery (ie Uber Eats) and just ignore my order (that I had already placed in person) for a good 15 mins even though I was waiting there. The wait time for my one medium sized drink was 20 minutes and the place was virtually empty at 6pm on a Tuesday. I've been twice and this was always the case and now I can't see myself returning.\n",
      "Great and creamy boba spot! Happy we finally had a good boba place in the Allston area. Cha time and Kung fu tea are not up to quality these days\n",
      "I like the teas at gong cha but how I wished their pearls were better. My jaws get sore from chewing the pearls.\n",
      "me and my friends went there on Tuesday (7/10) and saw the promotion of buy one get one free drinks outside of the store. so we ordered two cup of milk tea. However, instead of letting us know this promotion is only for their top 10 drinks, the cashier girl told us that the promotion was gone already. So we paid for our milk tea and ordered some fire chicken too. Again the cashier girl didn't told us that if we pay cash we got 32% off.  We just found out this information online and the promotion is actually from 7/5 - 7/20.  Their staff are not being honest to the customers!!!!!\n",
      "They have the promotion of buy one get one free from 7/5-7/20, we went on 7/10 and ordered two cups of milk tea, we asked the cashier isn't it buy one get one free because she charged us two cups' price，and she said the promotion is already gone. We bought the fried chicken too, she didn't tell us there's 32%off if we pay in cash. We just found those information from an online post, so mad that girl lie to us! If the shop really want to do the business, train your employees to be honest to the customers!\n",
      "I love love this place. Typically when bubble tea places start a new branch location,  the taste can be inconsistent. This isn't the case, I get the same great flavors as ones I get from Chinatown location.\n",

      "My tip for you:\n",
      "If you are not into drinking syrup level sweetness, get yours with 30% sugar - I learned this lesson the hard way and didn't enjoy my first gong cha experience \n",
      "\n",
      "If you like foam drink and pastry taste - get the milk foam with your drink..I happen to not like my drink tastes like sweet pastries so I would skip this.\n",
      "This is probably the worst gongcha I have been to because of the attitude of the staff/cashier. They are having a grand opening promotion for buy one get one free from 7/5 to 7/20, so me and my friends went in there and ordered two cup of milk tea for the buy one get one free. However the cashier girl told us that the promotion was gone already and she is saying in the way that we are stupid that coming in for the promotion. So we paid for our milk tea and ordered some fire chicken too. Again the cashier girl didn't told us that if we pay cash we got 32% off. Basically they just try to trick us to come to that location...and make their customers feel stupid. Never gonna go back o that location again if their staff aren't getting more train at customers service\n",
      "The service is amazing! The cashier is new but is better than all the other employees. He smiled when we walked in and was extremely helpful when I had questions about the menu. He carefully, but quickly, crafted my drink and served it to me with a straw and napkin. The drink he suggested was excellent, and I would definitely come here again.\n",

      "Great staff with good boba !! Thats all i need with reasonable price. Will be coming back\n",
      "Best employees ever!! The guy made a mistake with my order cause he misheard me and was so nice about remaking my drink.\n",
      "We went their Tuesday night knowing they are having grand opening promotion B1G1. We order green tea with milk foam and lemon ai-yu white pearl. For the later drink, I was impressed how diversify a drink can be, very refresh drink during hot season here.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also order A1 fried chicken and A10 fried chicken with cheese. They taste just like the one back in college. I personally prefer A1. They give you to choose 2 diff source and 1 powder. Spice are kept separate from the chicken while the powder, they just spread on the surface. If you order chili powder, this is something you might consider first.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to say something about their service. When we get there, we have not experienced something mentioned from the previous reviewers. The cashier was so polite and patient, always have smile on his face. Maybe the owner read review and make improvements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we always love Gong Cha, and given this location, we'll definitely come back.\n",
      "The worst Gong Cha I've ever been to. \n",
      "\n",
      "They don't fully run their ACs on a day when it's 102 degrees outside. The counter service was so slow I waited for 20 minutes just to order a cup of bubble tea. This is supposed to be a fast take out place, but it's nowhere close to being fast. Should've rather gone to another bubble tea place nearby.\n",
      "Very nice place,  lots of options.   The taste of the tea is amazing.   The food quality is good,  lots to chose from.\n",
      "I like this place. Very good drinks and food. Bring back the pretty girl with long hair :( I think her name was Lancy or something. They also test for pH balance in their drinks! Way to go above and beyond! It's also different from other boba shops- it's not ratchet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is much better now that they've been open for a while. Good things take time!\n",
      "I like this place better than Kung fu tea. Kung fu tea is too creamy but this place balances tea and milk perfectly. It's different from other bubble tea places. It's very spacious and nice, the WiFi is super fast. When school starts I am definitely gonna come here to do homework and relax. Service is not bad. Drinks come out a little slow but they just opened so it's understandable.\n",
      "The Lemon Aiyu is a must have for the different textures.  It is chewy with the white boba pearls, smooth with the aiyu jelly and a citrus note from the lemon.  it is refreshing and does not make you feel like you are bloated after drinking it.\n",
      "This is probably one of the best milk tea place I have been to so far. Very spacious and relaxing unlike other milk tea places so far in Boston area. The tea is very well brewed, most milk tea places don't have much of a tea flavor. Overall, this is a great place to have milk tea and relax to socialize with friends.\n",
      "The service here was top dollar.  When I first came the day they opened service, it took a while for my drink to be made, BUT with that said, they definitely now got their routine down, everything was quick and tasted great.  My order was taken by this really attractive girl named Nancy who also turned out to be the owner's daughter.  Goes to show their family is really dedicated to making sure their restaurant is running smoothly.  I will definitely be coming back and will definitely be bringing my friends.\n",
      "Always a good experience and that's why I'm a return customer. Selection of teas is off the charts, the staff is helpful and nice, explaining any item on the menu. Good spot to hang, go with a beautiful lady or study. Mixing any tea you want with a great selection of toppings. Go get yours now!\n",
      "I have only been here for the drinks so I can't comment on the food, but my friends have told me good things. They have a wide variety of drink options and I've enjoyed everything I have tried so far!\n",
      "This establishment does a dignifying job at providing both the best of services and drinks. The time between ordering and receiving our drinks was quite punctual, if not exceeding all expectations. The workers are nothing short of friendly, professional, and lively. I would highly recommend this place to all those who enjoy a relaxing atmosphere with great drinks and food that embody the Taiwanese culture at its finest.\n",
      "Worst customer service!!!!! Waited 45 minute and had to ask for a refund. I walked in at 5:55 asked for a refund just now 6:40. \n",

      "3 worker behind the counter working on 1 order and working are super slow mode. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't bother going here on the weekend. \n",
      "They are slow and do not know how to run a business. Plenty of other bubble tea places close by with better customer service.\n",
      "Tried the strawberry yogurt with ai-yu jelly for the first time and love the taste!(except for a little bit sweet) The drinks are good, but the more exciting part is the fried chicken! Love it so much!\n",
      "No offense to the first few reviewers, but this place just opened so the operation will be slow as the staff get used to the technology and flow. I remember the Chinatown one being slow too when it first opened. Lemon aiyu is a Taiwanese drink that might be an acquired taste for some folks. Usually, it is a form of lemonade or limeade with aiyu jelly. It's refreshing in the summer time. As far as I know, I have never found aiyu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiyu_jelly) as an option in Boston so I'm super excited that Gong Cha has it. One can find aiyu all over Taiwan. I also didn't care for the texture of the white pearls (which is like a lychee jelly texture) so I just ask for no white pearls and only aiyu whenever I get that drink. To each their own with these bubble tea places. I have friends who all have their favorite place in town. For me, in Boston, Gong Cha is one of my favorites. The Allston space is great for large groups (when it's not too busy). It opens until midnight which is terrific for late night hang out.\n",
      "Took 17 min to make a bubble tea. Staff behind the bar were talking on the phone and not even calling out numbers of orders when they were finished. Someone really needs to help train the staff so that customers aren't losing their shit waiting for a bubble tea they ordered almost 20 min ago.\n",
      "This Gong Cha has always messed up my order, every single time I'm there. From messing up sizes to messing up the actual drinks. They always enter the wrong thing in even though we tell them otherwise, they've even asked us to pay more even though it's their fault for not listening to us and entering the wrong items/sizes. Two girls even argued with me on whether or not there are pearls in my drink...and after a few minutes she looks at it carefully and realizes that she didn't add them in. Whenever they \"remake\" the incorrect drinks, they just pour the old drink into the new cup and add a bit more milk or a bit more tea directly on top into the cup - obviously that would offset the taste of the drink. Honestly, I would only go here if I was in the area, I have way better experiences at the chinatown location.\n",
      "Having a $5 minimum on credit cards then pricing your drink at $4.01 seems like a cruel joke.\n",
      "A thousand times bigger than the Chinatown location, but by far not the best. Since they had their grand opening B1G1 on select drinks (Pearl milk tea, lemon aiyu with white pearl, mango green tea, and winter melon tea) till Saturday 7/7, I decided to check out the place. The first time I waited a little and ordered the pearl milk tea, which was great. The second time I went I tried the lemon aiyu with white pearl. It taste like a strong lemonade with floating jelly (which is okay) and the white pearl (which has a strange texture). I think there was also other floating lemon bits in the drink too, which I wasn't fond of. I can't believe it makes the top 10 drinks list they have on the side menu! My friend got the pearl milk tea, which I tried and it tasted more bitter than when I had it before. She switched out the boba for pudding, which are the same price but still had to pay an extra 50 cents. They also didn't give much pudding compared to the Chinatown location. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is in conjunction with Cheers Cut, which serves a bunch of snacks/appetizers from fried chicken to giant fried squid as well as white rice. Hopefully the food makes up for the drinks here.\n",
      "This location is way better than the one in Chinatown. Bigger store, better menu (with foods), cleaner, well organized with lots of sitting area for chit chat and hang out with friends. The milk tea are the same as the one in Chinatown but they have foods menu too. The finger foods are great and delicious. I will definitely hang out here more.\n",
      "Solid drink: earl grey less ice 50% sugar \n",
      "Big space easier parking compared to the Chinatown gong cha. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried strawberry pearl the other day- sweet taste like strawberry pocky - I would lower ur sugar level if you add this.\n",
      "Gong Cha has finally opened up in Allston! This was very exciting because there are so many Gong Cha stores back home in China and HK and bubble tea is something that I crave often.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite part about Gong Cha is that their drinks have more concentrated tea flavour. It's milky but you can actually still taste the tea, unlike other bubble tea places in Boston. However, the boba quality isn't as good as Kung fu tea, it's less sweet and less chewy but still soft. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up ordering the milk foam green tea (no sugar, less ice, with bubbles) which is always great. Wouldn't suggest no sugary though, it is somewhat bitter. I think 30% sugar will be my standard from now on. I have also tried the earl grey milk tea and milk foam oolong tea. I like how you can taste the different flavors of the foam and then drink into the tea. They should use a removable lid for the milk foam drinks (like in Asia) so you can actually taste the flavors from top to bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, don't forget to subscribe to their loyalty program by giving them your phone number! You can collect points which turn into cash credit\n",
      "I am obsessed with milk tea cheese foam. Here me out- I know it sounds weird but it's sooo delicious. It complements tea perfectly. It's like a cream cheese whipped cream. My go to order is green tea milk foam, no ice, 50% sugar, with a cap (not the plastic seal- this is important to get a bit of foam with every sip!). Other places mimic cheese foam tea but this place does it the best by far.\n",
      "Tea, 5 stars. Food, 0. Please don't order any food there because the wait is real. I'm not gonna comment on the food because when I got them, I was literally raging. Ordered two small dishes and waited for 40 minutes. Till they sort out their mess in the kitchen, I'm not gonna go for the food.\n",
      "Quality milk tea with fast service. This place is always very popular, and they are combined with a food place. So you can get food and milk tea in one! I have tried the classic pearl milk tea as well as the earl grey latte. 70-100% sweetness is perfect. The pearls are delicious, and the tea tastes really shines through. I liked the pearl milk tea better than the earl grey, though.\n",
      "I've drank waaaay less bubble tea these past few years but GongCha got me hooked again these days!\n",
      "\n",
      "I loove my milk teas to have more flavorful teas and GongCha is the place! My go to order is the Oolong Milk Tea with Herbal Jelly! Pudding in it is also pretty good. I love the stronger oolong tea in the drink, the best of both worlds in terms of milky and tea. I love the herbal jelly here, unlike other bubble tea shops with herbal jellys that taste like it came out of a can, GongCha herbal jelly is prettyy tasty :) \n",
      "\n",
      "I screwed up ordering my go-to drink on the app, I assumed the \"Oolong Milk Tea with Pudding\" was what I wanted, but this wrong order turned out pretty darn good. The pudding is a similar texture to the herbal jelly but a tiny bit sweeter :) \n",
      "\n",
      "Fun Fact: When ordering a milk tea on the app, just literally order milk tea and you can pick your teas/toppings for the drink. They're usually pretty quick about making these drinks and I love that in the Allston one, when its ready, its your name on the bag. You just pick up and dipp!\n",
      "\n",
      "GongCha is definitely my top BBT place right now! :)\n",
      "It's pretty good, depending on who makes it. I feel like the new workers always struggle a little more, so I almost always expect my drinks to be wrong, but they're pretty good about correcting it. I just feel bad when it holds up the line. They have wifi and some sketch people there sometimes. But most of the time, it's usually college students who study there.\n",
      "We ordered two drinks with white pearls but neither of them had that. What's the point that we pay extra 2 dollars but with nothing coming!!!\n",
      "Place was busy. Service was fine and pricy was reasonable. The food was a hit or miss. The grill beef was a bit overcooked. The chicken was crispy and Well season. The curry was delicious and the other items were fine. The bubble tea was just okay. Nothing special about it. Probably, will.pass on coming back.\n",
      "I came here with my roommate who is thankfully a bit more knowledgeable about the menu than I am. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have stopped in, I'd be too intimidated. \n",
      "I got a milk foam black tea with boba thinking I was ordering black milk tea. Because I don't know anything. But I was very happy with what I ended up getting. The milk foam was unique - kind of creamy but also salty. It really went well with the slightly sweet tea. And the pearls were good and fresh too. \n",
      "Inside was nice and clean, and spacious. Plenty of room, although it was a Wednesday night and I have a feeling this place can get pretty crowded on the weekends.\n",
      "Paid around $9 for two drinks. Not an everyday thing, but a nice treat every once in a while.\n",
      "I love Gong Cha!! I think it's one of the best boba shops, definitely my top five -- if not, top 3! Their teas and toppings taste sooo good. One of my favorites is their dirty brown sugar boba, a must try.\n",
      "This place is great!\n",
      "They serve great milk tea and a lot of choices.\n",
      "Do not hesitate to taste their food. The Crispy Chicken is wonderful. Tasty and looks amazing.\n",
      "For the most part Gong Cha is very consistent as a bubble tea chain. It tastes the same throughout Asia as it does throughout the U.S., everywhere I have gotten it. Fragrant tea flavor and never watered down. This Allston location has a lot of seating and is good for groups to hang out as compared to the Chinatown location. \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually get the Earl Grey Milk Tea 70% sugar, and sometimes the Brown Sugar Milk Tea. Brown sugar is good but it is very sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday I got the Earl Grey and there was bits of black hard pieces on some of the boba... kind of tasted/looked like the black part of a marshmallow when you burn it. Confused as to what it was, my brother had this in his drink as well. First time this happened and it wasn't bad enough to ask for a new drink, just kind of confused.\n",
      "Not really impressed with their offerings although I only had the fried foods didn't try the beverages as this spot is a two for one store. The dipping sauces were really good the squid was tough the beef lacked beef flavor and the chicken was just like a salty flavor well fried though but not memorable.\n",
      "Awesome Bubble Tea place.  Also sell food on the other side, got Samurai Crispy Chicken & Fried Giant Squid. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "I mean, this place is its namesake, right? The drinks are all the same regardless of location. Given that, I wasn't impressed with this one in particular due to lack of service. The music was too loud, and it wasn't a friendly atmosphere at all. I felt rushed to grab my drink and go.\n",
      "I am so happy that this place opened up so close to me (instead of having to choose between going all the way to Chinatown or getting boba from a closer but not-my-fave place). Unlike its Chinatown location, this place has seats! Probably because it's in conjunction with Cheers Cut, the Taiwanese friend chicken place that it shares a counter with.\n",
      "\n",
      "You order your boba and chicken from the same place but they have two different pick-up counters. The ordering was pretty flawless and the line was quick. Quality was on point and same as the Chinatown one. Just don't have anything bad to say. Will be coming back here often for my boba fix.\n",
      "One of my fav boba places in Boston.\n",
      "But tip: contrary to Yelp's hours, they close at 11pm.\n",
      "I love Gong Cha teas and drinks (best coffee milk tea in the area), and even the food is good--try the grilled squid. The problem that I have is that things are always too loud. Sometimes the music, sometimes the people. Today I had trouble hearing the cashier 3 feet away and am still having trouble hearing my friend at our table because of the music which is an easy fix. Long term some sound dampening materials would be great to think about also.\n",
      "Finally got to try Gong Cha and it didn't disappoint! I had a big lunch yesterday so I wanted to get something refreshing, and ended up getting the lemon aiyu drink while my friends got strawberry matcha lattes with milk foam and the strawberry oreo drink. My drink ended up being my favorite (always ask for 50% or less sugar and less ice), but the rest were tasty as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would say that this place is a bit pricey for bubble tea but I would come back. Our drinks were made quickly, but we had to ask for the milk foam on the lattes because they forgot, and according to my friends who live here, they literally forget every single time, which is not a good look...\n",
      "The bubble tea here is very good. I usually get the oolong milk tea with white pearls. I think the ingredients they use are very fresh. Also enjoy the white pearl option; very tasty!\n",
      "Hands down the best bubble tea in Boston. Their bubbles are the freshest and most consistent. Most other places have smushy bubbles cause they are too lazy or cheap to make fresh ones but not gong Cha. My go to order is the oolong milk tea with white pearls (if you haven't tried this is a must! So chewy and hold up longer in fridge than regular bubbles if you can't finish your drink in one sitting) no sugar (cause the white pearls are pretty sweet when they add it) and light ice.\n",
      "I went there 9/9 and i order two drinks the drinks were fine but I felt like you guys didn't do a good job on your hygiene. There were workers there that doesn't even TIED THEIR HAIR OR WORE A HAT and they are girls with long hair and I just see their hair swooshing everywhere. You guys totally need to work on your hygienes. And I went there today again and I order a ninja crispy chicken and i didn't check it or anything when I got home I put did on the table and it fall on the ground I'm aware that it's my fault that I didn't put it steady on the table but I didn't expect that chicken wasn't wrap in any secure wrapping, just with a simple cardboard with two sides open which I also felt like there's a hygiene problem cause it's very expose to air. :(\n",
      "Update: My first milk tea of the new year and sadly i was kind of bummed out. It was like bad or disgusting but it lacked any flavor. The pudding was alright but it was just like flan consistency but with the flavor of the texture. The milk tea was watered down even asking for less ice. For being 70% sugar level there was absolutely no sweetness at all. Again it wasn't like the worst milk tea but i really wish they tried making the drink as it seemed like they just rushed to get it done with and not actually paying attention to any ratio etc.\n",
      "So glad this location exists! I've been to the one in Chinatown and I have to say thankfully this one is a lot more spacious and less cramped than that one. \n",
      "\n",
      "My go to drink lemon ai yu with white pearls! It tastes similar to a lemonade but not as tart and more of a tea hint to it obviously. The white pearls are so good! It's similar to chewy, jello like bubble that gives it the extra filling without as many calories as normal boba (at least I like to tell myself that)! \n",
      "\n",
      "I like that you're able to customize the ice and sugar level, you can ask for more or less ice in a drink as well as percentage of sugar. Normally I go for the 30 or 50% depending on what I'm getting. I would highly suggest this if you're not a sweets person because the drinks can be pretty sugary if you buy them as is.\n",
      "Gong Cha is definitely one of the better bubble tea joints. I feel like the flavor of their original milk tea is definitely more authentic compared to most places and I also love their other tea drinks as well! You can customize your drinks, which I always get less sugar.\n",
      "Got the taro milk tea with boba and milk cap. Got small minced meat rice as a snack. \n",
      "\n",
      "The minced meat rice was very good, although I wish there was a bit more meat. It was still delicious though. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taro milk tea was also pretty good. I got that with no sugar and pearls (boba). I thought it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all. I would say, compared to Kung Fu Tea the tea here is not as creamy but the taro flavor is a bit stronger. The boba tastes older than KFT, a little too firm. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would say that this location is good, but I would prefer a tea from KFT as I prefer creamier drinks, but the fact that Gong Cha has food items makes up for it.\n",
      "I really like this location of Gong Cha! It has a lot of seating, enough space for a long line, and is joined with Cheers Cut (a Taiwanese street food stall). I like to try different drinks whenever I come, but I always get boba with them. The last time I visited, I got the matcha with milk foam. It was the first time I ever tried milk foam for bubble tea and it was pretty good. A little salty, a little like the cream cheese flavor of cheesecake. Sadly, the matcha itself was much too bitter and not sweet enough (I got 75%). Stirring in the foam helped the flavor a little. I think for me, I should have gotten matcha milk tea with the foam? because maybe it would have been sweeter and more to my taste.\n",
      "The bubble tea here is just as good as the Chinatown one. This place is cleaner, nicer, and has lots of seating. Bubble tea is pricey ($5-6) but it's worth it.\n",
      "The food here is really good. I got a minced meat on rice (the small was pretty large) and the special, the huge Taiwanese fried chicken. Both were really good.\n",
      "I ordered a Strawberry Matcha Latte with boba, it was delicious! I should've had them added a little more ice to make it stay colder along the way back to work. This is my 2nd place to go to place for bubble tea!\n",
      "SLOW. AS. HELL. It takes like forever for your orders to be made because those workers they don't move! I don't even know what they are doing, they don't even look like they are making drinks...\n",
      "\n",
      "Their drinks are mediocre at best. It's like drinking water.\n",
      "The cashier told me she doesn't speak Chinese, but then turns around speaking mandarin fluently to her work mate. Surprise mf!!\n",
      "The good thing about this location is that there is seating and enough room to stand indoors while you wait to order. It can get busy but it's not any better than the Chinatown location. You can get your favorite drink comfortably and I do like that there's a Cheers Cut at this location which is something I still need to try. Boba and fried foods... some of my favorite things under 1 roof!\n",
      "Last time i came here, asked for a MF green tea with 100% sugar, and they put 0 sugar. And this time, i asked for a same thing, and same shit happens. After they put the sugar in, it tasts like syrup. worst bubble tea place in boston, dont go to this one, go to the one in chintown, this one is literally shit.\n",
      "I am usually a big fan of Gong Cha, but I had a particularly meh experience at this location which left me slightly disappointed since I was excited that a new location had opened closer to my apartment. \n",
      "\n",
      "My meh experience mostly has to do with the service, which I am willing to let go given that this place is relatively new and probably still working out a few kinks. It was just I had a really hard time communicating with the cashier because of a language barrier (which I am not faulting her for), but I just found it to just add to the inefficiency of the system since there were multiple times where another employee had to stop what they were doing and help her out. I normally wouldn't get annoyed at this, but given that I had waited in line for a while already and that there was a huge line behind me, I thought that perhaps this could be an issue. Plus, I also wanted to order food from Cheers Cut and found the ordering system to be unclear. Apparently there is only one line for both businesses, which in my opinion is hugely ineffective. I think it would be more efficient to have separate lines and ordering systems between the two businesses in order to speed up the lines (especially if you wanted to only order from one of the two businesses!) \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of my drink, I know I ordered the wrong thing because I found the strawberry green tea to be really watered down and essentially lacking in sweetness. I really like Gong Cha's milk foam teas so I'm sticking to that for next time. However, whether it will be in this particular location or not, I'm not so sure.\n",
      "I prefer the Gongcha in chinatown over this one, even though this one is bigger. It didn't give me a bubble tea shop vibe but more like a dark run down restaurant? But for the drinks, the passion fruit lychee drink was made with 30% sugar, or at least I hope they put 30% sugar because it was still incredibly sweet. If that is actually 30% sugar i don't even want to know what 100% sugar is like. They also don't have the chocolate milk tea here as well which i was disappointed in because that's one of my favorite drinks from Gongcha, as they only had like oreo chocolate or other things with chocolate. Not the best but it isn't bad.\n",
      "Favorite milk foam/cheese top tea in Boston. Always order the milk foam green tea with 30% sugar. If the boba at Kung fu tea is too sweat for you, then you might like the boba here better.\n",
      "Came here with some friends to get some bubble tea, and we were all pleased with what we got! I ended up getting a large Taro Milk Tea. The menu has a lot of cool options, and I want to come back and try some of the strawberry flavors they had.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also neat that they allow you specify how much sugar and ice are put into your drink; other bubble tea places often mess up these things, so it's great that you are allowed to customize it yourself. I ended up getting regular (70%) sugar and light ice, and I was happy with my tea! The milk tea itself is alright, but the boba pearls were soft and sweet. Worth trying if you're in the area!\n",
      "I'm a huge fan of the location in Chinatown! Gong Cha is my favorite bubble tea place so it makes me sad to say that this location falls short. I came here with some friends after dinner at a nearby restaurant for some dessert bubble tea. I ordered my usual taro bubble tea slush, but instead of the usual awesomeness, the boba was hard, tough, and chewy plus the flavoring of the taro was off. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I did like that this location is much larger in size with lots of tables to sit at and that they serve Taiwanese food. The interior design is pretty nice and makes for a kind of laid back cafe environment. Of note, they do have a $5 minimum to pay with a credit card.\n",
      "Ordered the Oreo Milk Tea and it was extremely watery and the boba was really soggy, likely meaning it was a bit old which was a big disappointment. Overall, my drink was very sub-par and I could barely finish it and probably won't be returning.\n",
      "One of the best place for bubble tea drinks . I always ordered the matcha green tea with red bean, bubbles, and herbal grass jelly, least sugar and ice. It's always a long line when I comes here. Staff could have a better attitude . I have to say Asian are the worst with customer service and I wish they improve here. Otherwise it's a good place for a nice drink to go or sit down\n",
      "It was my first time trying Gong Cha and I'm never coming back here again. First of all, I was greeted with attitude by this cashier. Second of all, after ordering my drink with less sugar. I saw that she put 50% sugar instead of 70%. I asked if she could change it to 70% and I got so much attitude! She smacked her lips and corrected, \"so less sugar is 50% not 70% by the way\". Like I'm sorry for not knowing the percentages?! I'm just here for a drink to quench my thirst, not a mouthful from someone! She also did not give my cousin any time to order and rushed her with her topping selections. Go somewhere else if you want better service!\n",
      "A staple for bubble tea in Boston, Gongcha is always really consistent with their milk teas. I usually get the Earl Gray with 3 J's since it comes with a lot of toppings and I find it to be the best deal, but their oolong milk tea and Oreo drinks are pretty good too. This location in particular always has a decent amount of people when I go and depending on the line, it can take a few minutes to get your drink, but that's typical of most bubble tea places. If you're looking for a consistent location that delivers the drink you expect, Gongcha is the place to go.\n",
      "Third time here and the drinks are so much better than when they first opened at this location! My drink was pretty good and customer service was good also. Quick and simple. Love how much space there is compared to the one in Chinatown and faster service too. Was able to sit down and enjoy some bubble tea. They also sell food here haven't tried it but heard it was good. Glad to know that this location has improved since they opened!\n",
      "First time ever leaving a review in yelp as I seldom have really really bad experience that totally ruined my mood (for three seconds at least). I wish I could give -1 star for the front desk service with the english-only female staff with braces (try to get a name from other staffs but failed). I tried to ask if there's any drink matches with the new topping in both Chinese and English in three times. She has no intention in trying to understand others. Dropped my credit card on the floor without any kind of apology. Omg. Never going to come here EVER. There're more and more chicken and milk tea places in Massachusetts now, u guys need to start getting worry if u keep this kind of staff. 88\n",
      "Better and faster than the Chinatown location, this Gong Cha delivers where other Boston shops cannot. The quality and consistency of this branch is the same as every Gong Cha I've been to. personally think Gong Cha is the best bubble tea around these parts of Boston, the Milk tea has a strong black tea aroma and the bubbles aren't too sweet and have a nice texture. I have only had Thai Milk tea and Original Milk tea with bubbles but both are great choices. I personally reduce the sugar to 30% and little ice but any decision you make will be a good one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Done blind taste testing with myself and friends for mulitple bubble tea chains and shops. Gong Cha was consistently everyone's favorite.\n",
      "I ordered a milk foam oolong tea and it didn't have milk foam. I couldn't believe it. Were they dreaming when they were making food?!\n",
      "So I've ordered boba teas with my sister from Gong Cha, and there's a variety of tea flavors and boba toppings you can choose from! My #1 go-to is the Lemon Ai-Yu with White Pearl, but I am also partial to their Strawberry Pearl that they serve every summer. What takes it down is the service because of its inconsistency- this one time, my sister and I had to wait nearly 30 minutes to figure out why our orders were coming out later than the people who ordered after us.\n",
      "Great and fast service. My fave is the oolong milk tea with herbal jelly. Perfectly made every time!\n",
      "Customers are a bit loud but it's whatever.. \n",
      "Bonus: they were playing ONE OK ROCK at this location!!! My fave band of all time. \n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "Bubble tea is one of the most loved drinks among Asians and is slowly gaining attraction from other cultures too. \n",
      "\n",
      "What they are known for?: Boba tea\n",
      "\n",
      "    Drinks: I must say this is probably one of the best boba tea places in Boston. However, I would argue this establishment is not known for the classic boba milk tea, but it's known for the many other drinks it has. I personally love the Strawberry Matcha Latte, which in my opinion is 8/10 at replicating the Strawberry matcha latte at Boba Guys. I would also recommend the Milk Foam Green Tea for those trying to venture off the milk tea trend.\n",
      "    Tea: The tea in the drinks I must say is the best out of any boba tea establishment in Boston.\n",
      "    Boba: unfortunately the boba I must say are a bit bland a lack flavor, but texture and gooeyness of the boba I must say is perfect.  \n",
      "   Food: They also have food for those are looking for a meal to go with their boba tea. They have their most famous food like the \"All Fried Squid\" which I must say is huge. \n",
      "\n",
      "What the place is like on the inside?: Chill\n",
      "  \n",
      "   Environment: The environment is a nice relaxing environment perfect for getting a couple of friends and hanging out. I would not recommend doing work here as it can get pretty loud, it is more of a friendly space to talk to your heart's content. \n",
      "   Vibe: It is a nice place to chill down from the summer heat. The music targets people from all different age and culture. They place Chinese songs, Top hits, and even some songs that are throwbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not the 5 stars then?: The wait (longer compared to other stores)\n",
      "\n",
      "   Ordering: Sometimes it takes a while for you just to get to the register I would say, when it is really busy it can take at most 15 minute (which is pretty long compared to other boba tea places), which can seem like forever. That is due to the store sometimes only having one person at the cashier. \n",
      "   Waiting for order: Unfortunately out of most of the boba tea places in Boston, Gongcha takes quite a bit of time to prepare the drinks. Again it is not too long as it is usually at max a 15-minute wait for the drinks, but it is still slower compared to other stores. So if you don't like standing around doing anything, then you can always hop on over to the bakery next door for some good bread. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: Best Boba in Boston (for now) for those who are more into the tea of the boba tea drinks and not really the milk.\n",
      "Gong Cha will always be my favorite bubble tea shop. Although I don't have one locally I always stop in one when I'm out of town. This location I found very convenient as I was eating dinner the BBQ chicken next door. It was very clean and the staff was patient and friendly when I took my time trying to pick what I wanted from their extensive menu. I ordered the Green Tea Milk Tea with white pearls. I had never had the white pears before, I ended up enjoying them. The milk tea on the other hand was absolutely delicious! When I go back I will make sure to order regular boba.\n",
      "I ordered a matcha milk tea with red bean. The place is clean and fast. The drink is so much better than other bubble tea stores.\n",
      "Had such an amazing time time at Gong Cha tonight! Debating in between two drinks and the cashier was able to help me narrow it down and suggested the perfect sugar and ice level for me. Love a great service while enjoying my bubble tea!! Def coming back again.\n",
      "I am super excited that Gong Cha has made their way out to Boston! The first time I tried Gong Cha was when I was in HK, and I thought it was the best boba I've ever had! \n",
      "\n",
      "They have 2 locations in Boston; the other location is in Chinatown. What I like about Gong Cha is that you can customize each drink to your liking. You can adjust the sweetness and amount of ice. They have many toppings and different types of drinks. \n",
      "\n",
      "My go-to drinks are the milk foam teas! I like how this spot has a lot of seating. Now I don't have to fly back to HK or go to NY for Gong Cha.\n",
      "I like this location way more than the Chinatown location. This one is packed too, especially since it's shared with Cheers Cut, but I find it a lot more efficient than the Chinatown location. There's always a bit of a wait for your drink but otherwise I haven't had any issues with service so there's not much else to say about this location specifically. Prices are pretty high but I think that's been the case with all bubble tea chains in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I'm a big fan of their new strawberry drink line! Strawberry milk tea was bomb and so was their strawberry taro latte. The latter is very sweet though, like drinking liquified candy, so I'd suggest bringing the sugar levels down a notch.\n",
      "Was not expecting another boba shop to open up in Allston, but I'm not complaining! I was really stoked to hear that Gong Cha was going to be closer to home because it's a far stretch to go to Chinatown whenever I wanted Gong Cha. Compared to the Chinatown location, this is by far, way better. It has seats, restrooms, and lines that don't stretch down the block. It's a great place to sit down, eat and sip on drinks, and catch up with friends. The service here is also really friendly and fast, unlike waiting 20 minutes for a drink. It's also a plus coming to the Allston location because it's conjoined with Cheers Cut, a Taiwanese street food inspired place. They have the huge chicken cutlets that I have yet to try. \n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to Gong Cha, I always get the same drinks. I love their brown sugar milk tea, oolong milk tea, and their mango yogurt. I typically ask for less ice and sugar, and it satisfies my boba tea fix. Generally, I go for boba or herbal jelly as my toppings. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also have other interesting drinks and toppings such as basil seeds or the panda series. Basil seeds go well with any fruity tea based drinks in my opinion, so I guess I'll try that out next time. I'll definitely be back to try the panda series or their white boba.\n",
      "One of my favorite boba places for sure. LOVE the panda milk tea which has black and white boba. The white boba has a different texture and is more gelatin like and less chewy. It's also less sweet, which I really like. I also really love their brown sugar milk tea! I've tried it at other places and none compare to the one here. Definitely try it! And if you like earl grey tea, their earl grey milk tea is also one of my go tos that you can't get at many places. 10/10 would recommend!\n",
      "Nice open clean space. Good place for lunch and enjoying milk tea. My to go place for milk tea in this area.\n",
      "Always a must when I'm in the allston area! Passion fruit sparkling with basil seeds always it's the spot. Fizzy and bubbly almost like a soda but not as sugary!\n",
      "Ripoff! It took three days to figure out how to order in a pandemic they definitely did not have it together! . First i arrive and they say \"you may not order in person!\"  then i go home, go on Gong Cha app, it doesn't work! The app gps is dead.\n",
      "I go back to ask \"how do you order a tea? \" The sign says \"you must use Chowbus or Ubereats. \" \n",
      "Next day I use chow bus app. It is unclear . I order 1 pearl tea. It says delivery in one half hour!  it charges $3.00'tip and 3.99 for delivery totally $12.99 for a medium pearl tea. And i cannot cancel it on the app. I message Ging Cha  \"I am\n",
      "Picking up no delivery needed . \" They say \"fine \". They charge for delivery and tip anyways because they say that's not their app! Then they fix the tea because they made it wrong ! Ripoff! Amateur!  Inefficient! Avoid this franchise. Kung Fu tea  scross the Street is great efficient and honest and not confusing and good tea adoesn't cheat you! \n",
      "\n",
      "Well When I complained,  Chowbus apologized and refunded both the tip and delivery charge! So I increased my rating because the milk foam tea with pudding  is pretty good ! But should I be working so hard for one medium iced tea?\n",
      "I ordered my go-to caramel milk tea while my boyfriend ordered his brown sugar milk tea. Both orders were as expected, consistent with other chains. Love gong cha's milk teas, one of my favorite bubble tea spots. Consistency of the pearls are exactly what I prefer. Will always return.\n",
      "The price showing on the menu board is different from their register. I ordered 2 large Honey Lemon Green Tea which show $5.50 each on the top menu board screen.  The screen on the register shown Honey Green Tea $5.25 and $0.75 for Lemon =$6.00. They are over charging customer $0.50 per cup. I asked the cashier but all he said was the price on the system is up to date and the price on the menu board is old and still over charge me without fixing the price. I told him this is the third time I am seeing this and I don't mind talking to a manager if he or she is available. And i don't mind paying for the drinks if they really updated the price.  Imagine if people are being over charged $0.50 a cup and they sold 100 cup a day, that is $50 day and that could be $1500 a month.  I just want to let the community to be aware of this and pay more attention on the pricing.\n",
      "I was not one to buy boba tea but gong cha changed me. Their taro milk tea with tapioca pearls is to die for. They propel the mix the taro and the milk so that the combination of the two are even throughout your drink. You're never drinking a ton of milk or a ton of taro at once. Service is quick but boba will always be pricey so just get ready to spend +$5 on your drank lol!\n",
      "Two weeks ago, my friends and I went here for a drink after dinner and I ordered the brown sugar bubble milk tea. When I got my drink, it didn't look like the picture at all. It just looked like a regular bubble milk tea drink. A bit disappointed.. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Christmas-themed cover for my drink was cute though.\n",
      "Gong Cha is one of my favorite places to get my milk tea fix! It's definitely one of the pricier chains when compared to Tea Do, Kung Fu Tea, or Chatime. This Gong Cha location shares a space with Cheers Cut, a Taiwanese eatery serving deep-fried/grilled meats, seafood, and more. Despite the amount of good seating, it can get pretty packed here on the weekends! \n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite thing to get is their strawberry taro milk tea. It's creamy, delicious, and perfectly balanced! The juicy notes of the strawberry + fragrant taro = ultimate dream team. I also really like their milk foam because it's thick, rich, and tastes wondrous. There was this one time where the cashier misunderstood what I was ordering and gave me strawberry milk foam instead of the regular one but I didn't mind it. It was definitely a happy accident- I didn't even know flavored milk foam existed! :'- ) I always order my drinks with light ice and regular sugar but you can customize it to your liking. A drink I'd steer away from is the strawberry matcha milk tea. It may sound delicious but the matcha flavor isn't very apparent at all. Stick to their matcha milk tea (with regular milk foam) instead!\n",
      "You could see remaining cream powder in a oolong tea latte. I took one picture but all 4 of them are like this. Did I misunderstand the definition of latte? What's the point of the overcharge? Very disappointed.\n",
      "horrible. Allston does not need fake and few others opened in other places related to this are terrible as bad in business but who knows rest may have good cook. I did not meet any nice Taiwanese in this restaurant, if you know what is Taiwan drink and food are about, you know what I mean. Basically faking whole business by using name of Taiwan. Manager did not admit all pictures and food are fake. And manager asked me to leave. In this town there are few places ask me to leave but, before they ask me to leave, they should study what Gong Cha want to do and bring level higher not lower. Most of staff seem don't even know anything about Taiwanese food, probably never ate any real Taiwanese before on their life. I mean food is up to who is cooking and serving.... my horrible experience hopefully does not happen to other people, but restaurant workers should learn al least respect humans. \n",
      "\n",
      "HORRIBLE\n",
      "\n",
      "STAY AWAY\n",
      "I ordered the brown sugar milk tea w/ boba and the pearl milk tea. both were pretty awesome, i had no complaints. nice flavorful tea, soft and chewy boba. there wasn't anything super special but nothing bad either. only one thing, and it's not a complaint really, but i couldn't quite tell the two drinks apart. drinks got a  3.75 on my boba scale but i'm a harsh grader so that's really good.\n",
      "Pearl Milk tea $5.50 (L) - has a good amount of nice chewy soft boba and 70% was not too sweet. Cheers is closed at the time because of Covid. I think their boba is way better than kungfu tea. They are less sweet compared to kungfu tea. Over all I would recommend but the price is a bit steep for a powder drink however that is the price in Boston.\n",
      "Not sure how serious the business own is with reviews. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing great about milk tea from this place from your competition across the street when it comes to milk tea. (I had gongcha when I was in China...the taste was amazing you can taste the tea, can't say the same in USA) \n",
      "\n",
      "I would appreciate if my drink was made wrong. You offer to remake a NEW one. Not recycle your toppings to re make another one. That's not good service. What you do w the mistake tea is up to you. Or even better offer it to the customer..after remaking them a NEW ONE!!!  Second time it happened to me....\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's be completely honest....you make 1,200% profit from that one tea you sell. Doesn't even cost you 0.50 cent to make it. But might cost you some customers.\n",
      "I ordered 3 drinks to be picked up and it's really a hit or miss w them. I ordered in advance to schedule a time for pick and it was 20 mins late. This order I had herbal jelly, white pearls, and basil seeds. And there isn't any herbal jelly.  Not sure who to give them my feedback when they mess up the order. I never check the order when I'm there, until after I get home I realized it's wrong. It happens more often than I want. For a drink that is almost $8 I would expect them to be a little more careful. This is more than a Starbucks and with Starbucks I get a free drinks for their inconvenience.\n",
      "Gong Cha is my go to boba place in Boston and the drink flavors themselves are pretty consistent. The location is in a great spot for when you go out to eat with friends and still fiend for boba after! \n",
      "Service is pretty fast and the workers are friendly as well. \n",
      "My go to drink has been the dirty brown sugar milk tea! I personally love mixing the foam into the drink, so I always get it sealed so I can shake it. Theres a lot of brown sugar in the cup, so it evens out the taste. It also makes it taste sweeter in my opinion, but if you're not a big fan of sweets definitely lower the sugar. \n",
      "The only problem for this location would be that the boba is a hit or miss. Some days it's perfect while other days it's not as sweet or chewy as it should be.\n",
      "Other than that, it typically satisfies my boba cravings!\n",
      "Gongcha is definitely a go-to for boba runs. However, the quality of the drinks here are kind of inconsistent in my opinion. In the past, I've had some really poorly made (like drinks leaking out the sides, sticky plastic cups, adding ice when I asked for no ice, etc) but also some pretty decent ones. I would say that the quality of the Allston location is on the lower end so if you can, go to Cambridge or somewhere else. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gongcha overall is good but the quality definitely depends on which location you go to. The boba texture has also been inconsistent for me at many of the Gongcha locations I have been to, ranging from tasting like day-old to really chewy and delicious ones. It's a hit or miss kind of thing for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "My usual orders would be the mango green tea, pearl milk tea, passion fruit QQ tea. They have all been good and I'm excited to explore the rest of their menu, like the coffee and strawberry series. Their drinks are also pretty affordable and you get what you pay for. Try it out if you haven't already!\n"
