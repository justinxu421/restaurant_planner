That was enough to pique my interest, so on a spectacularly warm March day, we decided to walk to Boba Me in Mission Hill. The space is open and well-lit, and there are nice games like Jenga, etc. on the tables for you to play while sipping your boba. We got the black sugar boba, 25% and it was really tasty. The boba were a bit on the smaller side, and less gelatinous and more chewy, and just a tad sweet -- all in all, very yummy. The tea itself was also quite good, although light on the tea flavor and heavy on the molasses. I actually loved the smokey, spicy bite of the molasses but I could see it being a little bit much for people who are more used to traditional milk tea.\\n\\nWe also couldn't resist the flaming hot Cheetos crinkle cut fries. While I'm pretty sure they're just microwavable fries topped with crushed flaming hot Cheetos dust and sour cream and cheese, it was AMAZING. Slightly spicy, crunchy, greasy, and yummy; good portion size too.\\n\\nAll in all, we paid $10 for the two items and enjoyed ourselves a lovely game of Jenga. I'll be back!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been wanting to try Boba Me for quite some time and I finally did! Boba Me has definitely changed the game in the area as it's giving students and people who work in the area to have GOOD BOBA. Boba Me has exceeded my expectations for good boba in Boston. Coming from California, I get picky about the quality of tea and the texture of my boba. Many places in Boston are a hit or miss, having the boba be over or undercooked. Boba Me's boba is CONSISTENTLY good, which is honestly so rare. I got the brown sugar milk tea with oolong tea, and it's probably my favorite milk tea-based drink in Boston! The quality of the tea is also great, as you can taste the oolong, along with the other flavor notes in your drink. I love the aesthetic of the drink as well, as you can see the brown sugar trickle down your cup. I'm not too hardcore on sugar, but they are pretty accommodating on your sweetness preference! They have a pretty small menu compared to other stores, but they just opened, so I'm sure they will be releasing new drinks (as it says on their menu as well).  \\n\\nThe interior is very clean and I love how you can grab a seat with your friends to chat or do homework. I love the concept of this store as it's spacious and it doesn't get too loud with the students living on Mission Hill. They also provide games and a pretty aesthetic purple wall to take all of your drink pictures against. The service here is friendly and I can't wait to come back to try new things!\",\n",

I got the milk sugar tea, or something like that and if you know what I am talking about I recommend getting 25% sweetness because it is very sweet for at least me at 50%. The boba cup was also the cutest thing I had ever seen! Not only was the boba good and good looking but the decor of the place was amazing!!',\n",

At first glance I thought it was a beautiful drink with the brown sugar streaks running down the cup. First sip...I thought it was super sweet. I couldn\\'t exactly pinpoint what I didn\\'t like about it but my drink overall just tasted like sugar water. It wasn\\'t as milky as I would have liked. Brown sugar milk is definitely the trend and I\\'ve had it super sweet but there was something about the sweetness here at Boba Me that gave me a headache. The boba was also way too chewy from being on the hard side. The boyfriend got the taro milk tea and wasn\\'t a fan either. The texture was just off. I realize that it\\'s hard to make taro milk tea without powder but I think the powder they use contributes to the weird texture of the drink.
