I hate the menus above the cashiers because most people get to the cashier just to look at the menu while holding up the line. Instead you can just walk up to the wall and pick out what you want, once you know what you want you can get in line and order. Their step by step on the wall is great for boba noobs haha.\",\n",

I would definitely go back to try drinks with toppings like pudding, basil seeds. \\nA huge thumbs up for letting the customers pick their sugar level and ice level for their drink, which got me saying \"yayyyy!!\"\\nThe available options for sugar are :100%,70%,50%,30% and 0.\\nI ordered the classic- pearl milk tea (cold) with 30% Sugar. There medium one costed me $4.55 which I would say is not great with price, but not bad either. \\nThey do have an option to chose soy milk over regular milk. Why did I drop a star you may ask. The place is strictly a take out one in d mall .No seating area available within the store even if you do want to sit and sip. Probably made sense as it\\'s in d mall,but again...',\n",
