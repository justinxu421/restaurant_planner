I remember the Chinatown one being slow too when it first opened. Lemon aiyu is a Taiwanese drink that might be an acquired taste for some folks. Usually, it is a form of lemonade or limeade with aiyu jelly. It's refreshing in the summer time. As far as I know, I have never found aiyu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiyu_jelly) as an option in Boston so I'm super excited that Gong Cha has it. One can find aiyu all over Taiwan. I also didn't care for the texture of the white pearls (which is like a lychee jelly texture) so I just ask for no white pearls and only aiyu whenever I get that drink. To each their own with these bubble tea places. I have friends who all have their favorite place in town. For me, in Boston, Gong Cha is one of my favorites. The Allston space is great for large groups (when it's not too busy). It opens until midnight which is terrific for late night hang out.\n",

Whenever they \"remake\" the incorrect drinks, they just pour the old drink into the new cup and add a bit more milk or a bit more tea directly on top into the cup - obviously that would offset the taste of the drink.

The first time I waited a little and ordered the pearl milk tea, which was great. The second time I went I tried the lemon aiyu with white pearl. It taste like a strong lemonade with floating jelly (which is okay) and the white pearl (which has a strange texture). I think there was also other floating lemon bits in the drink too, which I wasn't fond of. I can't believe it makes the top 10 drinks list they have on the side menu! My friend got the pearl milk tea, which I tried and it tasted more bitter than when I had it before.

I normally wouldn't get annoyed at this, but given that I had waited in line for a while already and that there was a huge line behind me, I thought that perhaps this could be an issue. Plus, I also wanted to order food from Cheers Cut and found the ordering system to be unclear. Apparently there is only one line for both businesses, which in my opinion is hugely ineffective.

I was really stoked to hear that Gong Cha was going to be closer to home because it's a far stretch to go to Chinatown whenever I wanted Gong Cha. Compared to the Chinatown location, this is by far, way better. It has seats, restrooms, and lines that don't stretch down the block. It's a great place to sit down, eat and sip on drinks, and catch up with friends. The service here is also really friendly and fast, unlike waiting 20 minutes for a drink. It's also a plus coming to the Allston location because it's conjoined with Cheers Cut, a Taiwanese street food inspired place. They have the huge chicken cutlets that I have yet to try. \n",

      "They also have other interesting drinks and toppings such as basil seeds or the panda series. Basil seeds go well with any fruity tea based drinks in my opinion, so I guess I'll try that out next time. I'll definitely be back to try the panda series or their white boba.\n",

I told him this is the third time I am seeing this and I don't mind talking to a manager if he or she is available. And i don't mind paying for the drinks if they really updated the price.  Imagine if people are being over charged $0.50 a cup and they sold 100 cup a day, that is $50 day and that could be $1500 a month.

There was this one time where the cashier misunderstood what I was ordering and gave me strawberry milk foam instead of the regular one but I didn't mind it. It was definitely a happy accident- I didn't even know flavored milk foam existed! :'- ) I always order my drinks with light ice and regular sugar but you can customize it to your liking. A drink I'd steer away from is the strawberry matcha milk tea. It may sound delicious but the matcha flavor isn't very apparent at all.
